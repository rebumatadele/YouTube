        "title": "How to revive a language you\u2019ve forgotten",
        "transcript": "I often get the question, how\ndo I maintain all my languages? I can't possibly maintain\nthem all at the same level. So today I want to talk about\nreviving or rediscovering or picking up where you left off on languages\nthat you have previously studied. I don't know how many of you have read\nor are aware of the book In Search of Lost Time, \u00c0 la Recherche by Marcel\nProust, but he talks about memory and involuntary memory and how, when he\nwas, for example, either offered a madeleine and dipped it in his tea. It's T and that reminded him of a\nnumber of other related pleasant experiences from earlier in his life. And we have a lot of involuntary\nmemories or memories or things in our memory reserve, which we can always\nfind ways to retrieve and bring back. And this includes languages\nthat we have studied before. So that's what I want to get into today. You know, we have the European\nframework, which attempts to define where you are in a language. Uh, there are other, uh, benchmarks\nlike in Canada, where they try to define where you are. And I always find these somewhat\nquestionable because they try to define who you are in the language so\nthat you can show it to other people. But what matters more to me is. Where do I think I am in the language? And so the levels that I look at in\nterms of language are either absolute beginner, and I will do a video on\nhow I begin a language from scratch. Then the second level is that long\nplateau where you have the feeling that you're not progressing at all. And then the third is what I call takeoff. So this is a new kind of stuff\nwhere you're no longer worried about whether you're progressing or not. You're just enjoying the language. And because you're enjoying it\nand continuing to listen and read and talk and all this stuff,\nyou're gradually improving. So today I'm going to talk about\njumping back into a language that you were active in before, and necessarily\nthat's going to be in that video. So if you're in that first stage, where\nyou're climbing up in the dark and trying to get a toehold in the language, which\ncould be the first three to six months, depending on the writing system and other\nconsiderations, vocabulary, don't let go. Because if you drop it, then it'll be\nvery hard to get back to where you were. You'll almost start from scratch again. Whereas once you've reached the plateau\nand it's a long road up at the plateau there, but you can always go back. At least that's been my experience. So in a way, reviving a language\nthat I did before is a bit like what I do when I'm on the plateau. And I should say as well, that I never\nworry about languages that I left behind because once I'm on the plateau, because\nI know they're there, they're, they're These memories, call them involuntary\nmemories that I have, things that I can retrieve at a later date and which\nI will look forward to rediscovering, like dipping my madeleine in the tea\nto kind of revive that pleasant memory. So it doesn't ever bother me. I don't, you know, sit there and say, I\nhave 20 languages that I claim to speak. And so every day I'm going to have\nto spend, you know, half an hour on each in order to try to maintain them. I don't worry about it. Just let them go. When I want to go back, I will go back. So what do I do when I want to go back? First consideration is motivation. Why do you want to go\nback to that language? So in my case, I have 20 languages. I have languages that I speak very\npoorly now, but which I was not that bad at before, uh, not very\ngood in some cases like Greek or Romanian, but I know it's there. I have recollections of being in\nCrete or, or being in Romania and speaking in those languages, uh,\nor even Korean for that matter. And right now I would have difficulty. So which one am I going\nto choose to revive? One example of where I went back\ninto a language that I had left, and I'm going to show you all of this,\nuh, from my statistics, my profile at LingQ, showing you exactly what\nmy activities were at different stages over a five, six year period. But I hadn't done much on Turkish\nfor quite a long time, but I had a reason to get interested in Turkish,\nwhich was the fact that my wife and I were going to visit Turkey. So that is a trigger. Now I've left Turkish, put it on the\nback burner, not worried about it at all. I know I can go back there\nand I want to work on Persian. And here the motivation is. That I want to take my\nPersian to the takeoff level. I consider B2 to be takeoff. So I'm not at B2 in Persian, far\nfrom it, but I feel myself getting stronger and stronger, and when I\nget to B2, then I feel I'll, I'll be like I am in my stronger languages\nwhere I don't need to worry about it. I can always turn it off. I'm not there yet. So there, the motivation is to get\nto takeoff, but different people can have different motivations. It might be travel. It might be a long cherished desire to\nget to a better level in that language. So now you want to focus in\nand pick up where you left off. So that motivation is a big part\nof why you choose to revive a language that you studied before. Now, the second issue, when we\ngo back to revive a language is what content are we going to use? And my practice, typically, when I go back\nto a language, like I did with Turkish, before I sort of revved up my Turkish\nlearning, I go back to the mini stories. You could go back to your beginner\nbook, to your teach yourself. You have to go back, in my experience,\nto some of the earlier material. You will notice things you actually\ndidn't even notice the first time. You will rediscover or, you know, Find\nfamiliar material that you recollect. You remember having listened to,\nyou remember having gone over. Uh, you can typically move more\nquickly through this beginner material than obviously you did the first\ntime, which gives you some degree of confidence and momentum going forward. So I feel that you need maybe\na couple of months even on predominantly, depending on your level. For sure. But you need to go back to\nsome of this beginner material. And in my case, it's very often\neither the mini stories or my teach yourself book or a combination of both. But soon thereafter, in terms\nof your content selection, you have to try to move forward. And here we have the\ntypical plateau difficulty. And that is that there's a lack\nof lower intermediate material. Some of it may not be that interesting. The stuff that really interests\nyou is very difficult. So there you simply have to force\nyourself, perhaps nudged on by statistics, like at LingQ, deal with somewhat less\ninteresting material or, uh, get on to genuinely challenging material. So with Turkish, I did the many stories. Then at LingQ, we have the material, like\nthe Baja stories created by my tutor Baja. And this stuff is sort\nof lower intermediate. And so I can go over this material. It's quite interesting, but it's\nnot tremendously interesting, not as interesting, let's say as material\nthat's too difficult for me, like history books by Elber or Teile. So I kind of try to mix these\nlittle bit of mini stories. And I go to sort of intermediate\nmaterial and I tempt myself with more difficult material. And I retreat back. But all the while, even though you don't\nthink you're progressing, I'm always encouraged by my statistics, which\ntell me that I in fact am progressing. And I'll, I'll get to\nmeasurement a little bit later. But if I look at my Persian, I'm now\nat a stage where I can listen to the Parse podcast, which I mentioned before. And he's talking about morality. He's talking about religion. He's talking about history. And I understand a lot. And so I had this powerful sense\nthat I'm approaching takeoff. And so I'm in sense, you know, with\nPersian and I'll show you the evolution of my Persian activities over five years. But there really all I'm committing\nto is to spend more time with things that are of interest to me. So it's easier. To make that content selection when you\nare at a level where genuinely interesting material is actually very accessible. So the next sort of issue is what sorts of\nactivities, how do you balance listening, reading, speaking, writing, uh, in terms\nof how you want to revive the language. And I think there, the important\nthing is to do things you enjoy doing because as we know, language learning\nis all about attitude and time spent. If you do things you enjoy doing,\nyou will have a positive attitude. If you do things you enjoy doing,\nyou're likely to spend the time. So if you have a positive attitude\nand spend the time, you will improve. But specifically, what do I do? So in my own case, and I've\nmentioned this before, listening is the easiest thing to do. I listen first thing in the morning,\nlistening triggers my curiosity about the subject matter, but also\nmy curiosity about the words and the sentences that I didn't understand. And that will normally trigger me to\ndo some work on my iPad using LingQ at some point in the late afternoon. And when I get to a level where\nI can actually read a paper book. Which is easier to do, uh, in a familiar\nwriting system, the Latin writing system than say in Arabic or Persian. But I try to nudge myself towards\nbeing able to read a paper book, because I believe that that sort of\nsolidifies my hold in the language. And if my goal, for example, in\nPersian right now is to get to B2, I have to get to a stage where I can\nread a paper book and I'm by no means there, uh, yet, but I, again, I'll go\nover my progress in Persian with you. And the other thing I do\nis I step up my speaking. So right now I'm speaking\nthree times a week in Persian. I'm at a level where I can have very\ninteresting, comfortable discussions on history, on politics, on current events in\nPersian with mistakes, with missing words. Uh, and then I get my report back\nfrom my tutor and I go over that. And so I feel that's a big part of my,\nyou know, striving towards B2 in Persian. I was also doing a lot of speaking with my\ntutors in Turkish before going to Turkey. But there, my goal, I was, let's say,\nrealistic that I wasn't going to achieve B2 in Turkish, but I was hoping to. To improve my ability to speak\nso that I could use the language while visiting the country. Those then are the kinds of\nactivities that I would engage in as I'm trying to revive a language. And finally, I want to talk about\nmeasurement because when we are reviving a language, this means that we. We hopefully got past the\nfirst sort of steep climb stage and we're now on the plateau. The plateau is the stage where we don't\nreally sense that we're improving. And so that's why measurement\nbecomes so important. The measurement is important\nbecause we don't want to be in a situation where we're frustrated\nwith ourselves that we slipped back compared to where we were before. We want to accept the fact\nthat we are improving. In fact, when we go over ground\nthat we went over before, we end up Strengthening our hold on that material. That's research has demonstrated. It's almost like cross country skiing. If you're going over a track that someone\nelse has gone over, that you've gone over the second time, you're going to go more\nquickly and the same when you retrace, Uh, or recreate sort of neural connections. Again, I'm no neuroscientist,\nbut you end up with a better hold, uh, on that material. So there's nothing wrong with going\nover and retracing your steps, you know, when you rediscover the language. But the measurement is a big part\nof, in my case anyway, motivation. I sense my, uh, you know,\nknown words total increasing. I told you that I set my goal of,\nof getting my known words total in Turkish up to 35, 000 words. That, that was a bit like the, uh,\nyou know, the carrot that I wanted to get to, to ensure that I, I had\nforced myself to do the necessary work every day on my Turkish. But we need to be realistic as to\nwhat these statistics mean, because, uh, in Turkish you can very quickly\nrack up a lot of known words, uh, which is not the case in Persian. I have a much higher known words total\nin Turkish than I have in Persian. And I speak Persian much\nbetter than I speak Turkish. So it depends on the\nnature of the language. And I should say that for me,\nthe statistics are more important than any objective test. I don't learn for others,\nI learn for myself. And the statistics are more as a\nnudge and a, and a motivation and a measurement of what I'm doing in the\nlanguage, which helps me decide what activities, where to spend my time. It's not something I use\nto show other people. I don't say, look, I know how to do this. These many words in this language\nas perhaps a TOEIC or a TOEFL score or IELTS score is, is needed to show\nothers what you can do in the language. I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in making my own\ndecisions about where I spend my time in the language or making sure that\nI sort of nudge myself to keep going. So the measurement for me is more about\ninternal, you know, allocation of time and resources and management rather than. Uh, showing others. So maybe to finish off, I'll\njust go over my profile at LingQ in different languages. I think we'll just look at the three\nlanguages that I've looked at recently and show you how I studied them for a while,\nleave them, come back again, what I do, and hopefully that'll be useful to you. So let me show you how I have been in\nand out of different languages, revived them, left them, come back and so forth. If I go to Persian, some of you\nprobably know this, but I can go to my profile by going here, clicking\non the drop list there, profile, and that'll take me into my statistics. I go here and I want to look\nat my all time statistics. To show you how I have\nbeen in and out of Persian. So start with the words of reading. And if I look at my historical\nperformance, you can see that I kind of build up to an ability to read in Persian. Went through, you know, a period of\nconcentration and I'm once again, concentrating on reading Persian, but\nit took me a while to ramp up because the writing system is different. When it comes to say, listening, uh, hours\nof listening, then you can see that it's easier to commit to listening because\nI'm not blocked by my unfamiliarity with the, with the writing system. Uh, and you can see that I will\nwork hard, then I leave it. I work hard for a while, then I leave it. It never bothers me. I always enjoy coming back to it,\nrediscovering it and pushing it further. Because the net effect over time is that\nI have more and more hours of listening. And since language learning is\na function of attitude and time, as I spend more time, I improve. Now, if we now look at Turkish where\nthe writing system is not an obstacle, we see here that if I look at my\nall time, say, words of reading, I can start reading pretty early. And so I went very heavy at Turkish\nfor a while, did a lot of reading and I left it for a long time. And then when I decided that we were going\nto go to Turkey, I went back in there. and work very hard in my Turkish. Uh, if we look at, for example, known\nwords, you know, I never worked that hard at Turkish and my greatest effort in terms\nof increasing my known words total was in preparation for the trip to Turkey. But even in the period where I'm\nnot doing as much, or even at the beginning period, I always enjoy it. And it's always there as\nsomething that I can go back to. So in Arabic I have 750 words of\nreading, again, the same difficulty that it's hard to get going reading. And then I go through a period\nwhere I do a lot of reading. Conversely, if I look at, uh, my, you\nknow, hours of listening in Arabic, I went very hard initially because the listening\nis something it's easier to get into. And then I kind of let\nit slide for a while. And every so often I kind of\ndo a little bit with Arabic. If I were to plan a trip to see\nthe new free Syria or Lebanon and I wanted to work very hard, I would\ndo what I did with, with Turkish. One thing, by the way, if I go back\nhere in Arabic, it says I'm advanced. It says I know 30, words. My Arabic of the three\nis probably the worst. That's not true actually, because I\nhave these things in memory and I hear stuff when I hear Arabic and actually\nin some ways, this is a reflection of my potential in the language. But until I focus in on doing a lot\nmore speaking and a lot more reading. And I also find that in Arabic, you\nneed more words than you do in Persian. For whatever reason, I\ndon't know the reason. So these statistics are not comparable,\nbut I know that I have a lot of mud lands waiting in Arabic that I can go\nback to and all I need is a trigger. Maybe a visit to an Arabic\ncountry, Arabic speaking country, and I'll be able to revive it. So it's just to show\nyou that I don't worry. About languages that I've learned before. I have them somewhere retrievable,\nreserved memory in my brain. Plus I have all of my previously\nstudied content and statistics at length that I can always go back to. So I don't worry about it. It's a matter of motivating\nyourself and spending the time and you can always revive languages\nthat you have studied before. In search of lost time, in\nsearch of previous memories. Okay, I hope that's helpful to you. Bye for now."

        "title": "How Chinese philosophy can make you a better language learner",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about mindset, the\nmindset for success and language learning. Now you may be aware of the book, The\nGrowth Mindset, but I'm going to get into something more than just a growth\nmindset, and I'm going to refer to the Taoist or Taoist philosophy of Zhuangzi. And now the reason I got into this whole\ndiscussion is I was sitting in my car. Of course, now we have podcasts. So in my car, when I'm driving\nanywhere, I'm listening. So I was listening to that. Persian language podcast, which I'm\nfollowing, which is very interesting. And I will be providing links to it. If you're learning Persian, Parseh,\nand he has this series on the roots of morals or morality in Persian, of course. So my understanding comprehension\nis not a hundred percent. But it's still fascinating. And he of course talks about the\nevolutionary origins of our morality and the morals of the behavior\nof, uh, animals, chimpanzees. And so I'm learning all these things. And one of the great joys of\nlanguage learning is that you can learn about things of interest to\nyou while learning the language, which is what I'm doing with Parse. And when I'm in the car listening\nto podcasts, I go to Spotify where I originally found Parse. Okay. And I find this podcast discussion\nbetween Jordan Peterson and Mark Andreessen, who is one of these tech\nguys, very wealthy person from California. And they're appalled at the woke mobs,\nwhich in many ways I sympathize with. And of course they exaggerate what they're\nsaying, but Jordan Peterson goes on about how we should be guided in our behavior\nby the, uh, And he refers primarily to, uh, English language authors, like\nI can't remember who, Shakespeare, Chaucer, maybe John Stuart Mill, or\nJungian psychology or, uh, Dostoevsky. And, you know, one of the concepts that I,\nand my sense that I've always held to be very important in language learning is a\ncertain degree of cultural weightlessness. So if you want to speak like a\nFrenchman, or if you want to speak like a Chinese person, you have to somehow\nget out of the fact that you are. It's in my case, in English speaking\nCanadian, that you actually want to get into that culture, get into that\nother set of, you know, behavior and, and, and the language, of course. So if we, uh, take this attitude of\ncultural weightlessness, then we say, why is Jordan Peterson so fixated on\nWestern thought and Western religion? Uh, if we look at the world, say, and\nI'm going to refer to Zhuangzi, the great Taoist philosopher, who's whom I don't\nfully understand, but I find interesting. He lived about 300 BC at that\ntime, 300, 500 BC, the bulk of the population, the world. Lived in Asia, China, in\nIndia, even in Central Asia. I mean, the Persian empire at that time,\nuh, was, uh, 30 to 50 million people. I mean, even in Central America, there\nwere 10, 15 million people, apparently. I don't know. I wasn't there to count them, but\nit's important to take a step back from your own culture when analyzing\nhuman behavior, because human behavior is not just a matter of your little\ntribe somewhere or cultural in group. And of course, when I follow Parsha's. Um, and he talks about the extent to\nwhich, you know, empathy and moral rules have existed in the animal kingdom to\nsome extent, even birds can sympathize with each other when we consider that\nthe Neanderthals are our cousins, not our ancestors, but our cousins, and that\nthey wandered the world for 250, 000 years before, uh, Homo sapiens, uh, you\nknow, So we have to have a certain amount of humility in making statements about\nwhat is moral behavior to suggest as Dostoevsky does, that if we don't believe\nin God, therefore there is no morality. Well, all the people who came\nbefore the Bible was written. Those people had morals too. They had some kind of moral conduct,\nuh, rules of behavior that worked for whatever society they were in. So we need to have that\nkind of detachment. And with that, I said, let's\nlook at Zhuangzi's teaching and how that influences us. When it comes to language learning, and\nof course Zhuangzi represents this Wu Wei, like in other words, effortless,\neffortless approach to achieving a lot. And in particular, I'd like to refer\nto four of his very famous parables. And any of these things that I refer\nto, you can check up on ChatGPT, which is a wonderful tool for getting sort\nof a shortcut to at least a superficial knowledge of a variety of things. And I've mentioned before that ChatGPT\nworks a bit like language learning. In other words, it's this sort of\nmassive input of information, uh, some degree of predicting what's\ngonna come, sort of iterative error correction, whereby gradually we get\na sense of the relationship between facts or the relationship in the\ncase of language between words and structures and how a language works. So it's a bit of a parable itself\nwith language acquisition, but let's get back to drawing as parables. The first parable that I would like\nto refer to is the parable of the crooked tree, which I used in my\nbook, The Linguist on Language. I even had a crooked tree on the cover. And the gist of it is that if you\nfollow your interests, if you respect your personality as an individual,\nthen you may be a crooked tree, which for the carpenter in Drung's parable,\nthe crooked tree is not very good for making furniture or for building homes,\nbut it follows its own personality. And. And maybe because it's crooked, you know,\nthe wood chopper won't chop down that crooked tree because it doesn't want it. But it's important to follow your natural\ninstincts and follow your personality. So that was the parable of the\ncrooked tree, which I took as a metaphor for language learning. You got to follow your interests and\nnot be guided too much by rigid rules of grammar, for example, or tests or\nother things that people submit you to. Just follow your own interests. And you will acquire the language. So in the sense of relax and joy and,\nand accept the crooked tree is the first parable that I'd like to refer to. The second parable that I also referred\nto in a book is Zhuangzi's parable of the fish trap, where he says, you\nknow, we need fish traps to catch fish once we have the fish, we don't need\nthe fish trap, we need, uh, you know, words for meaning, once we have the\nmeaning, we no longer need the words. What he's saying is, and this\napplies to language learning, the main thing is the meaning. So if you're working your way through\na text, as I do on LingQ, and I look up words and I find a dictionary definition,\nwhich I forget, like Zhuangzi throws away the fish trap, it doesn't matter. I am delving into and getting into\nthe meaning of the text as I do in my Persian podcast, which I read and look\nup words, talking about the, the roots of morality and so forth and so on. I'm totally immersed in the meaning. And I'm oblivious to the fact that I'm\nlooking at words and forgetting words. It doesn't matter. Gradually my. The ability in the language is\nimproving because I am relaxed. I'm enjoying it. I'm engrossed in the meaning of\nwhat I am reading or listening to. The next parable, which I again would\nencourage you to look up is Drunkard's Parable of the Butcher, who is effortless\nin the way he butchers the meat and he knows exactly where the joints are. And he's done it so often that it's\njust one fluid, effortless motion. And that's the. State that you want to achieve\nin your language learning. You aren't trying to refer to rules\nof grammar, trying to remember, you've just heard it so often. You've read it so often. You've used it so often that gradually\nthese things become second nature. And so you are in fact,\nlearning and growing in the language in an effortless way. And of course it is a process of, as with\nchat GPT, iterative error correction. So I'm sure the odd time the butcher\nhits, uh, you know, a sinew and therefore then gradually the more he\ncontinues doing it, he has a natural sense of the best where to place his\ncuts when he's butchering the meat. And finally, the fourth of Zhuangzi's\nparables is the parable of the butterfly, where Zhuangzi had a\ndream that he was a butterfly. And then when he woke up, he no longer\nknew whether he was a butterfly who thought he was Zhuangzi or Zhuangzi\nwho thought he was a butterfly, who had thought he was a butterfly. So here again, it gets back to this\nidea of cultural weightlessness. When I am with speakers of another\nlanguage, I try to have the feeling that I don't know if I am an English\nspeaking Canadian, if I am a, Persian speaker, if I am, and I can get\nmyself immersed into their culture. And, uh, I can also flutter above\nso I don't have to be anchored in the Western canon or into any\nparticular cultural, uh, process. Tradition, I am out there fluttering\nabout enjoying whatever language I want, whatever cultural tradition I\nwant, placing equal weight, let's say on Omar Hayyam or Zhuangzi or, uh, the\ngreat philosophers of Central Asia. Uh, again, I would, if I would use chat\nGPT to look up the list of the amazing philosophers, mathematicians, scientists,\nMuslim scientists of Central Asia between, I don't know, the year 800 and the year. 1200 or, or, or whatever. So this butterfly image of,\nof cultural weightlessness is also one that, that I enjoy. So we end up with these sort\nof four elements of a mindset, which is relax, enjoy yourself. Don't worry about how well you're doing. Take tests. Don't, uh, you know, allow\npeople to criticize you. Don't criticize yourself. Just relax. That's the R. The E is enjoy. I enjoy my Persian podcasts\nabout, from Parsay. And I keep looking for content\nthat I'm going to enjoy. It's very important to, to me that I, in\norder that I can continue with my language learning, I have to enjoy what I'm doing. So E is enjoy, A is accept. Accept the mistakes, accept when\nyou forget, accept the sense very often that we aren't progressing. Believe that you are progressing. I accept that I'm progressing. I just spoke with my Persian tutor. I don't think I'm doing well. She said, you've really improved. Accept that you're improving as long\nas you're enjoying what you're doing. And then finally be determined to succeed. In other words, persevere. You have to stay with it. You have to believe that\nyou're going to get there. Sometimes that's difficult to do\nbecause the progress is not obvious, but if you have that mindset that\nyou're determined to succeed and you have the other three elements\nof relax, enjoy, accept, and you're determined to succeed, you will succeed. So that's my little diatribe\ntoday on mindset for success. And, uh, in my next videos,\nI'm planning them out now. I'm going to be talking about\nthe importance of reading. I'm going to be talking about revisiting\na language, like say Persian, which I left for six months while I focused\nin, uh, focused in on Turkish and what I do when I come back, uh,\nbut I'm also open to suggestions. So if you would like to hear me talk about\nsome other subject, please let me know. All right. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "6 reasons I still buy language books in 2025",
        "transcript": "In this digital age, in this age of the\ninternet and, uh, podcasts, why buy books? I buy a lot of books. So today I want to talk a bit about\nwhy, and that provides six reasons. And three, what I would say are\ncautions about books, real books. Why do I buy them? First of all, as you know, I am a\ngreat fan of the digital environment for language learning that we live in. Access to content all over the world in\nso many different forms, audio, e text, podcast, YouTube videos, Netflix, any\ninformation you need about the language. It's all available at our fingertips\nand it's available on the internet. So it's sort of a digital world. Also, I spent a lot of my language\nlearning time on LingQ, where I can look up words, where I have audio, where\nI have statistics that keep me going. I can keep track of what I've been\ndoing and targets and so forth. So I'm very much into that. And I spent most of my language\nlearning time in a digital environment. So why do I buy books? And I'm in Palm Springs. I'm not up in Vancouver. I can't show you my vast library\nof books in different languages and language learning books. So I'm going to talk about. Some of the reasons why I think\nit's a good idea to buy books. The first thing about\nbooks is books are handy. Books are easy to pick up, take\nwith you to the toilet, read before going to bed or in bed. It's tactile. It's nice to hold on to. I like books. So any language that I get into, I'm\ngoing to begin by buying a starter book. I'm holding here, for example,\nComplete Ukrainian by Teach Yourself. As I've said before,\nI like Teach Yourself. I think they're good value for money. They're a good series in their\ncomplete series, complete Turkish, complete Ukrainian, complete Romanian. I've got lots of them. So, handy, tactile. I like the feel of\nhaving a book in my hand. A second reason that I like books\nis that in these starter books, Like Teach Yourself or Assimil\nor Living Language, I think it's called, you get some explanations. Now, I don't believe that I remember\nthe explanations, but if the language is completely new to me, even though\nI'm doing the mini stories and I'm being exposed to the language over\nand over again, I'm getting exposure to the patterns of the language,\nit helps to have an explanation. It gets you through the content. Even if you forget the explanation,\nit helps so that you're not totally like a blind person feeling your\nway forward in this new language. You get some explanation, the\nexplanation remains somewhat fuzzy until you have enough exposure in the\nlanguage, but it nevertheless does help. So the second reason why I buy books is\nbecause I buy starter books that help me. Get an introduction to the\nlanguage, the language, which at first is very, very strange. The third reason why I like\nbooks is because I like variety. And I've said this many times. You need to get the same content\nin a variety of different ways, in a variety of different forms. You want the same vocabulary to\nappear in different contexts. But also if I've been listening to\nsomething or reading it in a digital format, and I can then read it again\nin, Some kind of a hard copy, you know, paper feel type of environment. I believe it's handled somewhat\ndifferently in our brains. There's no distraction. There's no shine of the screen. So it introduces a different way\nof accessing the same content. And I enjoy doing that. Now, the next thing about books is\nthat they are sort of an enticement. If I'm starting in a language and I go\ninto a book, into a bookstore and I see a book on how to learn Catalan, for example,\nthis happens to be complete Ukrainian, but it could be complete Catalan. It's very enticing. I have this feeling that just by buying\nthe book, I've taken that all important first step towards learning the language. And in many languages, there are\nsayings that basically say the first step is the biggest step. And so the books kind of entice\nyou into getting started. Not only that, at a later stage, If\nI see books, for example, I have this Korean book here, which I bought a\nlong time ago when I was in Korea, or maybe was in a Korean bookstore in\nVancouver, and, uh, I have this feeling that one day I will read this book,\neven if now it's a little difficult for me, uh, you know, to read it. And, uh, so, that's why I'm,\nuh, paying, I'm paying for it. Tough for me to read. But every time I read it, it's a stimulus. It's a bit of content, plus it's that\nsense of one day I'm going to get there. I haven't really cracked this book\nopen since I bought it, but it's there, something that I can get to. So there is this sense of a mirage. Something that is moving you forward\nbecause in language learning, you know, the, the motivation is so important. So just as every little bit of input,\nlistening and reading helps, every little bit of motivation helps. So for me, books are an enticement. Even if I have 30 percent books\nat home that I have never really spent a lot of time with, it's\nkind of entices me to keep going. Now, the fifth reason why books\nare so important to me is because they are a permanent reference. I remember my first, you\nknow, teach yourself Russian or teach yourself Portuguese. I remember those and I can go back to\nthem because there are always points of grammar or patterns there that\nI have maybe neglected or I never noticed the first time through it. You can always go back to them as\na quick reference to the language. So I, I enjoy having books around as a\nhandy reference back to the language. And of course, the sixth thing is that\nwhen we do get to the stage, I'm not at the stage yet in Korean where I can read\nthis book comfortably, but when I do get to that stage, that's a major achievement. So this is sort of a, you know, a goal and\nambition to be able to read these books. And very often I will read the book\nagain at a later stage and find that, you know, it's much easier for me. For example, this intermediate Persian\ncourse, which I found very difficult because I have so much trouble reading. In the Arabic script, uh, I've\ndone so much reading on LingQ now that I'm getting better at it. And I was reading it the other day and I\nfelt quite proud of myself that I was able to read it more comfortably than before. But all of this is happening on\nthat sort of print paper book. Environment, which is a supplement\nand a reinforcement of the learning that I do in the digital environment. Now, there are some cautions. First of all, without the digital\nsupport, I simply find it too difficult to get into the language. There's not enough repetition,\neven in the, uh, Complete, you know, teach yourself series. They tend to go from one lesson\nto the next, to the next. And there's not a lot of\nrepetition of the vocabulary. That's where I think our, uh, many\nstories at LingQ are so powerful. The other thing is that inevitably,\neven though they have a glossary for each lesson, very often the words in the\nglossary Are not the ones that you don't know, you know, those, the ones that you\nneed to know are not in the glossary and words that were introduced in chapter one,\nyou've already forgotten them, but they're not in the glossary for lesson two. So it's like pushing on a rope\nto get going in the language without that digital support. The goal eventually is to be able to\noperate, you know, on paper, but initially without the digital support, it's Another\nproblem with these books is they assume that if you go from chapter 1 to chapter 2\nto chapter 3, you are therefore improving. Maybe you are and maybe you aren't. Many words remain difficult. In many ways, you could take chapter 1\nand chapter 5 and it would be just as easy as going from chapter 1 to chapter 2. So that it's almost misleading\nto have these books there with, you know, chapter 1, chapter 2. So you got to be aware of that,\nthat the books, you know, just by themselves are not enough to\nget you going in the language. That's why the digital\nsupport is so important. The functionality, the audio, being\nable to look at the text sentence by sentence, being able to look words up,\nbeing able to, you know, review the words that you didn't know, which may or may\nnot be the ones that are on the glossary list, all of this is very powerful\nsupport from the digital environment. So in summary, you know, the digital\nsupport is important, but the books are important and they work together. You need the digital support. And I, in fact, spend most of my time\nin that sort of digital environment, but I derived tremendous pleasure\nfor the reasons that I indicated from owning books, from reading books, by\nhaving books with me, holding books. And I think that having the two\noperating together increases our effectiveness and, uh, our ability\nto progress in the language. And I wonder if other people. Share my experience in this regard. Thank you. Look forward to hearing your views. Bye for now."

        "title": "7 reasons to listen before you read",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to give you seven\nreasons why I think we should listen first before we read. Now, I often talk about the importance\nof input, and I think many people recognize the importance of input,\nbut they sometimes wonder, is it better to read first or listen first? I believe everyone should do what they\nenjoy doing, because if you enjoy doing it, you're likely to continue doing it. So I will tell you what I do, and I\nwill tell you the reasons why I do it. I listen first. And there are seven principal\nreasons, which I've. Jawed it down. Before I get into that, by the way, I\nlooked up the perennial question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg. And there is an explanation online that\nthe egg comes first because the egg evolved from a reptile's egg, which\nthen became a chicken at some point in the evolutionary process, which to\nme doesn't really answer the question because then all you're doing is Pushing\nback to the reptile, which comes first, the reptile's egg or the reptile. But anyway, leaving that aside to me, the\nfirst reason why listening comes first is because it's the easiest thing to do. It's the first thing I do in the morning. I don't wake up and start reading and\nsay Persian, which I'm learning now. I get up and I get some audio,\nsomething that I'm listening to. It might be something out of Radio Fardo. It might be something from Link. I start listening. So it's the first thing I do. It's the easiest thing to do. You can do it wherever you are. I can do it while preparing breakfast. I do it in the car. I do it if I'm going\nto clean up the garage. It's just so easy to pick up some\naudio, put the AirPods in and listen. And I do make an effort to listen\nin LingQ cause then at least I get credit for those listening hours. Whereas if I'm listening\non some other app. I'm usually too lazy to manually add\nthose listening hours to my statistics. Now, somewhat related to that is\nthe idea that listening is something you can do while doing other chores. It's the same idea, but\nthe benefit is different. It's not because it's, it's the easiest\nthing to do, but it's because very often when we're, Studying languages. We kind of think, gee, I wish\nI were doing something else. Whereas with listening, you can\nhave the feeling that you are killing two birds with one stone. And you don't have to understand\neverything you're listening to. But again, it's part of this idea\nthat it's, it's easier to do. And also part of the fact that again,\nand I'm going to get into exercise, but first thing I do in the morning\nis I grab my Persian listening and I grab my app that I have for exercise. And I think the, the fact\nthat I can listen to my Farsi motivates me to do my exercises. And the fact that I'm doing\nthe exercises motivates me to do the Farsi or the Persian. So there's a symbiosis there, a synergy. And so the multitasking capability\nstrengthens our willingness to do both. And so therefore, to my mind,\nthe listening comes first. The third point is exercise. I wanted to delve a little\nmore deeply into exercise. There is research that shows\nthat first of all, exercise increases our cognitive ability. It might have to do with blood flow\nor whatever, but that's not the point. That is a fact. And not only during the exercise, but\nafter the exercise, if we increase our flow of blood, or if we're engaged in\nexercise, we are able to learn better. But there is very specific research that\nhas been done on learning vocabulary, which showed that if two groups are\nexposed to new vocabulary, And one group is on a, say, stationary bicycle, and\nthe other group is simply sitting there, then the group that's on the stationary\nbicycle will learn the vocabulary better. So I've actually experimented with\nthis now, and I'm going to perhaps do another video on the different ways\nyou can exercise and study languages. But apparently this works. So exercise improves your\nability to learn and to remember. Number four. Another reason why listening comes first. It's because the listening\nwill trigger the curiosity from a number of perspectives. So you're listening to something. Maybe you don't fully understand it. There are many words that\nyou don't understand. Maybe it's an interesting story. You want to understand the parts\nthat you missed so that you can better understand the whole story. So the listening is going to\ntrigger you to do other things. It's going to trigger\nyou to read that story. It's going to trigger you to look\nup words, possibly review the words. So again, the listening. It starts the process and triggers the\ncuriosity, and that's very important. Anything that keeps you going\non your learning tasks is good. Now, number five is that listening\ngives you a sense of familiarity about the subject matter. You may find in listening to\nsomething new that you're not interested in it, or you may find\nthat you're very interested in it. But the listening creates the atmosphere. You can't smell the smells, but\nyou can feel the atmosphere of whatever it is you're listening to. I still remember when I listened to, you\nknow, Russian novels or Italian novels, you know, Atzi Dzieci in the case of\nRussian, while jogging around the field here, or while, uh, you know, listening\nto I Primasi Sposi, pardon me if I like 19th century literature, while learning\nItalian, it gets you in the mood. And once you have that mood\nand familiarity, it's so much easier then to read. Again, number seven, it's sort of\nrelated to this idea that you gain some familiarity with the subject\nmatter, but it's more than that. It's this idea that you gain momentum. So you have heard it. You've heard the rhythm of the language\nand phrases and words have bounced around in your brain and you've got\nthe intonation and you've heard the person's voice and all of that gives you\nmomentum so that when you go to read. Because when we read, inevitably\nwe sub vocalize, you've got some of that momentum, that intonation,\nand it pushes you forward. You're not fighting inertia. You've got some momentum going in your\nfavor if you have been listening first. So that's the seventh reason why\nI think listening comes first. Now, people are going to say, when\nI listen, I can't maintain my focus. That's all true. And our ability to focus varies\naccording to many different factors. I, for example, find that I am least\nable to focus if I just sit in a chair and don't do anything else. I can't just sit there and listen. I gotta do something. Now, how much am I able to focus in? It's going to depend on my level in\nthe language, on my interest in the subject matter, the audio quality,\nthe narrator's voice quality. All of these things affect how\nmuch you're able to concentrate. Also, I Certain activities lend\nthemselves more to staying focused. So I'm able to focus\nquite well while driving. If I'm exercising or lifting weights, or\neven trying to organize my garage, it's much more difficult to stay focused. It doesn't matter because if you can\nlisten to a lot, you're getting this rhythm, the intonation, as I've said,\nall those good things, but you're also picking up words and phrases. And you may not get them all, but\nwhatever you do get goes into your database, into your reserved memory. And when we are reading or listening in\nthe language, we're constantly predicting what's going to happen in the language. This is based on MRI research. So we're trying to predict\nwhat's going to come at us. We don't know. To what extent these little bits and\npieces of words and phrases that we noticed while listening, even though\nwe weren't totally focused the whole time, to what extent is our ability\nto predict what's going to happen influenced by these little bits and\npieces, these words and phrases. Similarly, when we go to speak, we\nknow from research that we tend to grab words That we are confident,\nconfident we can use or grab structures that we're confident we can use,\nand we kind of shape our utterances around things that we're comfortable\nusing, or we think are going to work. And again, it's this error driven process. It's either confirmed as being, you\nknow, is going to working or not working. But in many cases, I think, again, we will\ngrab some of these words and phrases that for whatever reason we heard or noticed\nwhile listening, even though we were sort of fading in and out of the content. While listening. So I think people shouldn't take\nthe position that I'm only going to listen if I understand everything. That's not how listening works. You're going to understand better\nsometimes than at other times. And you're going to be able to\nfocus better in some situations than other situations. So to summarize, input is so\nimportant, listening and reading. Obviously, we all want to get to speaking\nand we want to speak a lot, but we need to have that listening and reading to give us\nthe weapons, the words, the phrases, the familiarity that we need in order to have\nsuccessful interactions in the language. If we listen and listen a lot, it's\ngoing to improve our ability to read. It's going to improve our ability\nto learn from our reading. And because it's easy to do,\nit's going to keep us going. So I'm not saying that listening\nis more important, but if I'm asked, which do I start with? Then I start with listening for\nall of the reasons that I outlined. And I'd be interested in hearing\nyour views on the subject."

        "title": "Why I won\u2019t be starting any new languages in 2025",
        "transcript": "Well, it's the end of the year and\nwe're nearing the end of the year. And, uh, I'm going to make a video\nabout my new year's resolutions. I did make a video last week\nwhere I talked about how the brain evolves during our lives. Some of the psychological inputs\nor, or, or background to how we react to activities, including the\ndecision on a new year's resolution. So the first thing I would\nsay is that there's nothing special about the new year. Apparently the ancient Babylonians\nhad New Year's resolutions, which were more like a commitment and other people\nthroughout history have also done so. But the new year, I think for the\nBabylonians was March, for the Romans was March 15th, for the Iranians, March 15th. For Nowruz is around March sometime,\nI think Chinese new year falls somewhere between January and February. So there's nothing special\nabout this time of year. And even in so far as making a new year's\nresolution, not every culture does this. Although many do, but, uh,\nyou can, uh, nudge yourself to get active anytime you want. Uh, it doesn't have to be around New Year. And, uh, the thing about the New\nYear's resolution, in my view, is that it's not sort of a goal,\nit's not a goal setting thing. It's not, I'm going to\nmake a million dollars. I'm going to get the body of a Greek God. Uh, I'm going to reach, uh,\nyou know, C1 in my Spanish. Those are not commitments to actions. Those are simply goals. You may or may not achieve those goals. Those things are outside of your control. The new year's resolution in my mind\nwould be, I'm going to go to the gym three times a week, though you\neither do that or you don't do that. Uh, I'm going to be active\nin language learning. For example, I can go to LingQ, like\nas I did with Turkish, I want to increase my known words total six\nmonths prior to going to Turkey. I want to increase my known\nwords total from 8, I know I can do that on the system. So that was an action\nthat I could control. I want to read so many words. I want to listen to so many. Hours of whatever language I'm learning. It's actions that you can control. That should be basically what\nyou are committing to do with your new year's resolution. I'll show you this. Lengthy dictionary\ndefinition of resolution. There's all kinds of meanings\nof the word resolution. I prefer the word commitment. And I gather that throughout history,\nwhether in ancient Babylon or in middle ages in Europe, these were more like\npledges, pledges to the church, pledges to people, uh, commitments rather\nthan sort of some vague goal of what you hope to achieve, which is not. To my mind, what a new year's resolution\nis, and probably to most people, however, you know, having a distant goal is,\nis certainly motivating and motivation is a big part of actually carrying\nthrough on your new year's resolutions. Now, apparently a high percentage\nof people do carry through on their resolutions, at least for\nquite a period into the new year. Of course, we all want to\nbe amongst those who do. And I think there it's important to\nmake it easy on ourselves in the case of language learning, find content of\ninterest to you, make sure you think that spending time with the language is\nvaluable to you, have a positive attitude towards the process and the language,\nvary the type of activity you're doing so you don't just sit there like reviewing\nAnki decks, you listen, you read, you review words, you talk to people, the\ngreater the variety of activity, The easier it is to stay with the language,\nremembering that the essential elements of language learning are your attitude\ntowards the language, towards the process and the amount of time you spent. So in order to make sure that\nyour commitment is fulfilled, try to make it easy on yourself. Don't get frustrated if you don't see\nimmediate results, because as long as you are active, you are improving. And it's important to be aware of\nthat and remind yourself of that. You might find it interesting\nto see how I spent my year. In language learning in 2024, we have\nthis year in review feature at LingQ and it shows that Turkish was my main\narea of concentration, not surprising, uh, as I was preparing to go to\nTurkey, but I did also spend a fair amount of time on Arabic and Persian\nand dabbled in a few other languages. Arabic was the number one language\nthat I listened to, at least according to my LingQ statistics, but of course\nthis doesn't reflect the fact that I did most of my listening, or at least\nnot necessarily most, but a lot of my listening on an app like Storytel,\nwhich is not reflected in the statistics at LingQ because I'm not able to\ndownload the MP3 file to convert it into a text or to get at any kind\nof a digital text that I could read. On the other hand, when it\ncomes to reading, Turkish was my main area of concentration. More than double my Arabic and\na lot more than my Persian. And I was active for, you know, 366 days. Baha, which is a course put together\nby my Turkish tutor, which is very interesting, was my favorite course\nin Turkish, or in any language, of the material that I did on LingQ. And I completed this many lessons,\nmost of which were imported, met a number of milestones,\nand participated in challenges. And I added a total of\n36, 000 known words. Most of that was in Turkish. So that's kind of my year, and now I'm\nlooking forward to the coming year. Which reminds me, we are hosting\na special sale until January 19th, 50 percent off to power your\nlanguage learning in the new year. Check it out. So with that introduction, which\nlanguages am I going to go after in 2025? Initially, and of course,\nwe all need a trigger. So New Year's can be a trigger for\na commitment, but in order to get really turned on to a language, you\nneed some other kind of trigger. And that's been my experience. Uh, for example, going to\nTurkey, six months, I was able to totally dive into Turkish. I've said before that my interest in the\nhistory of Central Asia and Middle East was a trigger for me to spend a lot of\ntime with Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. This year, my wife and I are going\nto Scotland and Ireland via, uh, So, uh, am I going to learn Irish Gaelic? I don't think so. Am I going to learn Icelandic? I don't think so. Why? Not because those languages aren't\nvaluable, but because in my experience, it takes so much time to bring your\nlanguage up to a level where you can actually function when you get to the\ncountry where the language is spoken. It's not a matter of weeks or months. And I've just had the experience\nso often where I actually did put a fair amount of effort into say\nCroatian or Vietnamese, I don't know. And I found that when I was\nin the country, I wasn't able to do as much as I had hoped. So I'm kind of reluctant to do that again. So it's unlikely that I will spend\nany time, maybe just a quick cursory look on Irish Gaelic or Icelandic. Now I had mentioned that we are getting\nboth Irish Gaelic and Punjabi at LingQ. So I said, maybe I'll learn\nPunjabi because there's a lot of Punjabi speakers here in Vancouver. We have Punjabi television\nand radio and so forth. And very often you come across people\nin stores and shops and taxi drivers who are Punjabi speakers, but there again,\nI'm kind of less keen on that now because from my experience, again, it takes a\nlong time to get to a level where you can have a meaningful conversation. I can learn enough very quickly\nto say, hello, how are you? And count to 10 in Punjabi. And maybe I'll do that just for fun,\nbut that's not meaningful to me. So then I kind of have slid\nback to my previous position. So my commitment is to stay active. I will definitely stay active,\nbut I think I want to go back to the languages that I have never\nachieved the level that I want to in. And the leading candidate\nto get to B2 is Persian. And so I'm going to commit. Myself to spend a lot of time on Persian. Again, for variety is the spice of life. I may go off and do some Arabic. I may go off and do some Turkish. So as not to fall too far behind in that\nfrom where I was when I was in Turkey. And I got to be careful, Turkey, okay. But we're all used to saying Turkey. And my hope is that I can\nachieve a B2 level in Persian sometime during the coming year. But my commitment, my resolution is to\nspend the time because we can spend the and there's no guarantee what we will. I hope that's of interest. I'd be interested to hear, uh, other\npeople's, uh, commitments or goals or resolutions for the new year. I will stay with my, uh,\nlanguage learning activity. I'm quite convinced\nit's good for the brain. I mentioned that, uh, Manfred Spitzer\nin his book says that, uh, you know, when we were young, we have. Poor impulse control. When we're older, we're easily distracted. Older people know more, they might\nbe interested in more things. There's all kinds of different things\nabout our temperament, our personality, our stage in life, which can influence\nhow successful we are in language learning, influence how successful we\nare in staying with our commitments. But I ignore all those things. Because whatever my temperament\nis, however suited I am to language learning, it really doesn't matter. You know, people say, Oh, you're talented. Or someone else is not\ntalented or whatever. It doesn't matter. I know that if I put in\nthe time, I will improve. And everyone who puts in the time and\nis interested in learning will improve. So whatever other theoretical\nadvantages or disadvantages, optimist, pessimist, outgoing, not\noutgoing, none of that really matters. None of that affects input activities,\nwhich is the core of language learning. Okay. So while it's interesting to look at\nthose things, and I thought it was very interesting to read his book and\nsometimes it maybe helps explain certain things, but basically it's simple. Commit to being active,\nstaying busy in the language. If you're on LingQ, get those reading\nstatistics, those listing statistics. Keep going, even if you don't\nfeel you're making progress. You are, and with that, I wish\neveryone a happy new year, all the best for the coming year. And I'd be interested in hearing what\nyour goals and commitments are with regard to language learning for 2025. Thank you. Bye."

        "title": "Learn a language in 2025 by setting the right goals",
        "transcript": "Hi there, it's that time of year. We're approaching Christmas. After that comes new year where we\nlike to make New Year's resolutions. And next week I will talk about my New\nYear's resolutions for the year 2025. But today I want to kind of prepare\nthe ground a little bit because I was listening to a podcast in Persian where\nhe was talking about the life of Jeff. And, uh, of course, Jeff Bezos, who is\nthe founder of Amazon was someone who throughout his life was very interested\nin technology and he was a bit of a risk taker and he was confident. And so in the end, and he was patient with\nhis Amazon project and he was successful, he was confident that he would. succeed. Now we can't all be Jeff Bezos, but\nit made me think about this whole issue of planning and resolutions\nand what we're going to do and can we stick with it and so forth and so on. And it reminded me, in fact, I went\nand grabbed this book, which is, uh, in German by my favorite German\nneuroscientist, Manfred Spitzer, and also Norbert Hershkowitz, who\nunfortunately recently passed away. Wie wir denken und lernen, full of wisdom. And again, Manfred Spitzer\nis a bit of a popularizer. So I can't vote for\neverything that he says. Uh, I found a lot of his\nobservations, very interesting. Uh, I, perhaps there are things that\nhe says that I don't agree with, as is the case with anyone whose views\nand opinions you value on some issues, but perhaps not on every issue. However, one example in that book is this. Chess player who is able to predict\nmoves forward in a chess game so much faster than anyone who has been\nstudying the rules of chess, because the experienced chess player has so much\nmemory, has so much knowledge that has accumulated that he can then project\nforward in terms of which moves are going to take place as a, you know,\nconsequence of whatever move he's going to make or the other player makes. And we know from research that. The brain, when it learns a language,\nit is actually trying to predict what's going to happen in the language. And what happens is either confirms\nwhat was anticipated, or the reaction is, is negative, this N400. If you say the pizza flies, I think\nas an example that was used, well, pizzas don't fly, so we have this\nreaction against the meaning and that. Process of getting rid of inaccuracies\nin structure or in vocabulary usage is a big part of how we learn. And of course, when we go to speak\nin a language, we draw from memory. We draw from words and structures\nthat we have in our memory reserve. Again, we project them forward. So we're constantly in our planning\nor in any resolution or any actions that we take, we are relying. On what we already know or\nwhat we have in our memory. And this is all pointed out in\nSpitzer's book, but Spitzer's book does more than that. He explains, and I think this is relevant\nto the Jeff Bezos example, that who we are and how we think and act is\nconditioned by amongst other things. But two main features of our\npersonality, one is our temperament and the other is our character. And he makes a distinction\nthat the temperament is something that we're born with. So we are risk takers or we\nare optimistic or outgoing. And these are things\nthat are in our genes. However, our character is based on our\nexperience on what we have learned, uh, how we sympathize with other people,\nthings that we find worthwhile, not worthwhile, our value system, all of\nthese things are tied up in our character. And these things evolve over time. And so our character continues\nto develop over time. throughout our, our life. And then Spitzer and, uh,\nHershkowitz divide people into different stages of their life. So say as a teenager, we're impulsive. In fact, as a little child, there's still\nthis process of pruning and blooming where unnecessary neurons are pruned. And those that are going to be\nimportant to us are somehow encouraged. And I think that's also largely, uh,\nas with language learning, this sort of Error driven process through experience. This is good. This is no good. The brain evolves in a certain direction. And this pruning, by the way,\ngoes on well into our twenties. And after that, apparently there\nis no more pruning of neurons. However, a number of things do\ncontinue to happen in our brains, which Spitzer and Hershkowitz talk about. And one of these is the improved\ncommunication with different parts of the brain so that\nthis, uh, myelin or myelination. Of the pathways of the brain mean that\nour decisions and the activity in our brain contains more of an element of,\nof, you know, call it the emotional side of the brain, a value driven part of our\nthinking, rather than simply a reaction to a meaning, in other words, we develop\na better ability to control our impulses because we have a more balanced reaction\nto things that come at us in our lives. And this then evolves sort of\nthrough our twenties and thirties. We become more empathetic\nwith other people. We have more values of our own that we\nhave arrived at through, you know, our own life, and I'm not going to give\nyou everything that's in that book. I suggest you get a copy of it. It might be available in English,\nbut in a period from our forties to our sixties is kind of like\nthe high point of our efficiency. We have this tremendous balance\nof value and yet the, the speed of our You know, neural processing\nis at a highly efficient rate. You know, we have this, uh, myelinization\nof our pathways in the brain. I don't understand all this stuff, but I'm\njust sort of popularizing the popularizer. So our brains are particularly efficient\nand people typically have families. They have a sense of responsibility. They have to worry more about the future. Whereas people in their twenties,\ntypically can just, uh, be driven by impulse and, uh, do whatever they\nfeel like doing, not entirely true. But as I say, he's a popularizer. There's some generalizations there. And then after the age of 60, the speed\nof our neural processing slows down. We are starting to lose more and more\nneurons, although I'll get back to that point, but we have acquired more and\nmore wisdom, more and more knowledge. We know more things and this helps us\nin our decision making and this then takes us through to our eighties. Uh, two things I was going to say on\nthat, by the way, is that, uh, one, while we lose neurons, we can afford\napparently to lose a lot of neurons. Like even if we're down to\n90%, that's still a lot. It doesn't really damage us. And there's a number of studies showing\nthat the, uh, you know, where a group of 70 year olds were asked to remember\nthings that they had just seen and they were compared to a group of 80 year olds. In their eighties and the seven year old\ngroup cohort was 87 percent accurate. And the 80 percent cohort\nwas like 80 percent accurate. So there's not a big decline. Now, how does all of that relate to New\nYear's resolutions and language learning? That's what I want to get into. So I wanted to suggest that our approach\nto New Year's resolutions, and I will give you mine next week, is going\nto be based on what we know, what we have in memory, our value system, our\ntemperament, where we are in life, in our twenties, our thirties, our forties. Any of these things can influence\nwhat we do going forward. You know, are we confident,\nuh, are we outgoing? Are we optimistic? Are we in our sixties,\nseventies, twenties, thirties? These influence things, but we\ndon't want to have stereotypes. I believe someone who maybe is not\noptimistic by nature, but because of experience of life and some success or\nsome interest in particular things, they may develop a very positive attitude. to choose towards, for\nexample, learning languages. But another interesting fact that,\nuh, Spitzer and, uh, Hershkovitz point out is that we react more\nimmediately to things that relate to our values than we do to meaning. So this they're able to measure because\nthe N 400, this negative reaction to something that either semantically, in\nother words, in terms of meaning or in terms of structure is not appropriate in\nthe language, that's 400 milliseconds. It's. But the positive reaction to something\nthat's an important value to us is faster. It's P200. And they explain that that's because,\nyou know, we had to be able to judge, you know, is this animal coming to eat us? We had to be able to judge\nthat very, very quickly. And so that reaction is very fast. So our value, Reaction is fast. That might explain why very often people\nin arguments and discussions react from emotion long before they listen to what\nthe other person is actually saying. Now, all of these different things\nthen take us back to what we're interested in is language learning. And when you prepare your\nnew year's resolutions, think about what your values are. Think about your ability to suppress. You know, impulses, even in learning\nlanguages, we have to suppress those words and structures that\ndon't belong, that come from another language that we have learned. So this idea of suppressing what doesn't\nbelong, suppressing what shouldn't be there, focusing on what we want, even in\nterms, again, of, uh, the massive amount of information that we have available\nto us now, whether it be in podcasts or on social media, like never before, or I\ndid a video where I talked about YouTube as the new university, there's so much\nstuff out there, we have to have that. Value system that enables us to\nsuppress things that we are not interested in, that we don't agree with. And there, in my opinion, we have to\nvalue people who have experience like the experienced chess player, rather\nthan jumping on the last little bit of information that's been thrown our way. So based on all of this, then what\nour value system is, what your value system is, your stage in life. If the type of person you think you are, I\nwould challenge all of you to come up with some resolutions, New Year's resolutions. In my own case, I have an idea of what my\nNew Year's resolutions will be, but I'm not going to divulge them until next week. So I just thought I would prepare the\nground for the New Year's resolution video that's coming out next week,\nto which you can all react with your own New Year's resolutions. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "This Italian polyglot speaks 15 languages. What\u2019s his secret? (feat. @LucaLampariello)",
        "transcript": "I'm speaking English, but\nI'm thinking in Italian. Not every student wants to\nspeak a language fluently. You know, nice to hear that, but\nI completely disagree with you. Hi, Luca. Hi, Steve. So today I have a special\nguest, Luca Lampariello. We're not the gang of four, we're the gang\nof many, the sort of polyglot community that often gets together at these meetings\nor communicate, you know, online, and we all have this in common that we're\nvery interested in learning languages. And we're going to get into a lot\nof subjects related to language learning, related to Luca's background. But I should say that Luca, who by\nthe way, has kindly sent me a copy of his book about language learning, who\nhas a variety of personal experiences and practical advice on language\nlearning, which we will get into. But in my opinion, in terms of Being\nable to speak the largest number of languages with the least evident non\nnative accent, you're right up there. Okay. You're absolutely right up there. I'm blushing right now. It's amazing, amazing, amazing. So, typically, Italians are\nnot considered your arch type. Polyglot, nor are the Brits\nor North Americans or, you know, Japanese for that matter. So could you tell us a little\nbit about your background? Obviously grew up in a monolingual,\nuh, Italian speaking family environment, neighbors, what were\nsome of the steps that led you to become this very proficient polyglot? How much time do we have? I'm kidding. Yeah, I'll make, I'll try to make it very\nbrief at the age of 10, I was learning English and French in middle school and\nI was not very good at it or at them. But then my parents decided to\nhire Susan, my teacher, my American teacher from Chicago, and as I\nsaid, in the, in the other videos that were recorded for my channel,\nshe inspired me more than anything. It's not just the instructions. It's not about the fact that she\nwas very eager to create material that asks, for example, recording\nvideotapes and movies, But it was her enthusiasm and her belief in me. She started believing in me and I\nstarted believing in myself, which is very important as a language\nlearner, because at that moment, um, that time I hadn't learned any\nlanguage to any degree of fluency. And when you haven't accomplished\nsomething, we haven't, acquired a skill yet, you're not sure you can do it. It's like riding a bike\nor dancing or swimming. You always have this nagging thought\nthat you can't actually do it. And this is probably a nagging\nthought that a lot of people have when it comes to, can I really\nget fluent in that language? Looks like a dream. So I think that Was something\nthat really was a game changer for me because I realized I can\nactually learn this language. And I remember that at the age of 12, I\ncould barely string a sentence together. I had a horrible accent. I used to, I still remember, I, I\nthink I wrote it in the book as well. I used to pronounce enough as\nenough, because as you know, notoriously, it makes sense. It makes sense. You read as you, as you speak in Italian. And the amazing thing is that after\ntwo years, I just went to Ireland because my parents sent me to, you\nknow, back in the day, three weeks to learn, to improve, perfect my English. And I still remember that the father,\nyou know, the Hulse family, he came to the airport and he started speaking. He said, why are you here? You're American. What were you doing here? And I was so proud that people were\nthinking, he thinks I'm American, even if I, if I had an accent or whatever,\nthe fact that I had moved from, you know, barely stringing a sentence together\nor being able to pronounce enough correctly and used to pronounce it as\na nug, a noug, and then people, you know, thought I was American in Ireland,\nthat was quite the accomplishment. And after that, I just realized. Wait a second. If I can learn English,\nI can learn French. I can learn German. I'm going to interrupt you along\nthe way as you develop your story because you say things that are very\ninteresting that I want to stress. So, first of all, the fact that as a 10\nyear old you are learning two languages. That's quite impressive, actually,\nin North America at 10, in many cases where you aren't learning any language. And the fact that your\nparents sent you to Ireland. In other words, you were in an\nenvironment where you were basically encouraged to learn languages. The second thing you said that\nwas very interesting was that initially you had a lot of trouble. Pronouncing the language and then\neventually you became and very quickly you became quite proficient and you initially\npronounce the language based on how those letters would be pronounced in a town. And I think there's a major problem\npeople have in pronunciation. They go with the value of the\nletters in their own language. There is a system in English. There is a pattern. It's a very indirect, convoluted\npattern, but there is a pattern to how that language is pronounced and\nyou were able to acquire that, and so I'm curious, so even before getting\nto Ireland, your brain had somehow understood that it's not a Naug, because\nthere are a lot of Italians who will say a Naug for the rest of their life. Yes. I use the example of my father\nwho would say, like, there's a province in Canada called Nova\nScotia and he would say Nova Scotia. Makes sense, right? Nova Scotia. I think your average Italian\nwould say Nova Scotia. To what do you attribute the fact that\nyour brain was able to get used to the pattern of English pronunciation? Desire. It was my desire of sounding and being\nlike an American, especially we're talking about America, because I was\nsurrounded by Americans, meaning that my. Teacher was American and she\nrecorded all these videotapes that were just American movies. I could imagine myself living in the\nUnited States, interacting with locals. And when people, for example, say,\nOh, you must have this absolute ear. I don't remember exactly what\nthe technical term is, that you must hear all the sounds. Yes and no. Meaning that the, the ear is a channel,\nbut what really makes a difference is actually your brain, not the ear. The ear is just like something\nthat the sound goes through. And I think that when, when people come\nto me, cause I, I used to work as a coach, especially an accent coach and people,\nfor example, wanted to know how do you speak like almost, of course, nobody's\nexactly speaks like a native, but how do you achieve great pronunciation? I always told them that the\npsychological part plays a huge role. Now, Steven Krashen is a famous linguist. Most of your viewers know about Steven\nKrashen and his theory about input, but he also talks about the effective filter. And about the fact that it's\ndifficult for us to acquire language when you're stressed. For example, at school, we asked\nthem about marks and performance. I think that when I was working with\nSusan, the environment was so positive. Her figure was so inspiring that\nI really wanted to sound like her. And I wanted to sound like all\nthose, you know, those people, actors appearing on screen of the videotapes\nthat she had recorded for me. And that made, made a huge difference\nbecause I was paying attention. I always say that one of the most\nimportant things when it comes to language learning, acquired grammar, learning\nvocabulary and whatnot, is noticing. If you notice things, if you notice\nthat a word contains another small word, that is the brain, you understand that\nif you notice that grammar pattern has something similar with something else. And if you notice sounds, then you're\nable to ultra reproduce these sounds. Everything happens in the brain. So on the one hand, it was my passion. I really liked language learning. The second thing is my, I\nreally wanted to blend in. I really wanted to sound like an American. And the third, I was paying\nattention to everything. I started paying attention to everything\nand, uh, Susan corrected me on the go. And I didn't just dismiss that and say,\nno, no, let me, let me think about that. And, uh, we talked about this in another\nvideo that we, we had, uh, you and I, I don't think that feedback and getting\ncorrected is helpful if you're a beginner and intermediate, but you went, when\nyou get better and better, then you're able to, Actually see the big picture. And when you get feedback, you're\nable to incorporate it and improve. I still remember some mistakes\nthat I made like circuitry. I said circuitry tree. And I remember it as circuitry, circuit\ninstead of circuit or specific things that I was corrected on, but I was\nready at an advanced level in English. So this is my story in a nutshell, when\nit comes to acquiring great pronunciation. I think that the effective\nfilter and wanting to. Sound like a native is\nreally, really important. I would, uh, totally agree with you. A few things that you said there that\nI think are really very important. In a sense, you want it to be an American. Okay. If I'm learning Chinese,\nif I'm learning French. I want to be a French person. I want to be whatever Chinese person. When I was in Japan and I was with a bunch\nof Japanese people in a business meeting, I'm not aware of being non Japanese. I'm part of that. And when we learn another language, we\nare learning to imitate another culture. So we have to like it. We have to see ourselves as part of that. And I've often called that sort\nof cultural weightlessness. Otherwise, if you say, okay, you would\nsay, I'm an Italian learning English. No, I'm a person of no culture\nwanting to be part of another culture. So that doesn't mean that you abandon\nyour Italian culture permanently. But while you are learning the\nlanguage, you want to be part of that. I think that's extremely important. And I think the other point that you\nmade, which is so important, and that is whether it is a matter of noticing\nor whether it's a matter of getting corrected for mistakes or looking up\ngrammar, those things are most effective when you already have a large amount of\nexposure and experience with the language. In the early stages, as you said,\nthe corrections are lost on you. It just makes you tenser. But later on, you go,\nyeah, circuitry, circuitry. You want to focus in\non some of the things. That you're struggling with that\nstand out as being sort of little sore points in what is, you know,\na large body of experience that you've had with the library. So I'm, again, I agree with you that\nthere's a time and place for everything. I'm glad you do agree with me. I wanted to, to add something else that\nI, it's, it's an interesting thing. When I started watching American\nmovies, what I did after the movie was rehearsing all these lines over and over. And I was not just imitating the, you\nknow, the, the sounds, but also imitating the way they're like their gestures. This is called pragmatics, right? How they accompany the, the speech with\ngestures and everything in between. And I think it's part of that\npaying attention subconsciously or unconsciously to the way people express\nthemselves in different cultures. To give you an example, we, No,\nthey speak like they have this way of, I still remember I was talking\nto the father of my ex girlfriend. We have spent countless hours with\nthem, embedded like in French culture. And it was just like, Hey, do you\nwant, want to go to the movies? That's And the other thing that I wanted to\nstress, which is really interesting, is that thought, to me, in my\nexperience, I'm not a neuroscientist, but thought is interwined with sound. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that if I start\nspeaking like this, I'm speaking English, but I'm thinking in Italian. So this is very important. What I'm going to say is Italian, what\nan Italian would say and not an American. And that's the interesting part. If I'm speaking, if I'm speaking\nAmerican English, I don't use my hands. And I don't think the way I would\ndo if I were speaking American English with an Italian accent,\nwhich is really interesting. And that's also the reason why I got,\nI don't remember exactly, but I was speaking, I made a video in Spanish\nand I said the name of an actor, I was speaking Spanish and I continued saying,\nfor example, Let me say Donald Trump. I would say, estamos hablando\nde Donald Trump or Donald Trump. I didn't change it because if I\nhad to switch from Spanish into American English, that would have\ndisrupted the flow of my thought. That's, that's, uh, an interesting\nthing that I want to, an observation that I wanted to, to make when it comes\nto sounds, which is a very complex. Topic within second language acquisition\nand first language acquisition. On the subject of pronunciation. And of course you're very good at you. Actually you do an\nItalian accent quite well. Thank you. I worked on that. But, um, obviously everyone's\ngoal is to pronounce as close to native as possible, but most people\nwill not get as close as Luca. And I, every so often I'll see\nsomeone on television and it might be a French minister of foreign\naffairs or something, or an Italian. Who speaks English so well, the\nvocabulary, the, the accuracy, the precision with which they use the language\nis, is so good of such a high level. Their accent in no way, the\nobvious French accent in no way detracts from the impression\ncreated by their use of language. So I just wanted to make the point that\nthere's so many different things we can work on in our language learning, our\nvocabulary, the turn of phrase, word usage, comprehension, and of course, we\nall want to improve our pronunciation, but there is no harm in having a noticeable. Accent. Would you agree with that? I agree 100%. In fact, the, the, the fact that I\nlike speaking almost like a native, not obviously not like a native, but\nit's just something that I really like because I enjoy the process. I really like how the language sounds\nin my mouth, but it's not strictly necessary as long as people understand me. Of course, if the accent is so\nbad that it's not intelligible, then we got a problem. You still, we have problems, I would say\nin taxes, but in general, I believe that intelligibility is the most important\nthing, as long as you articulate and you have a decent accent, or at least\nan accent that is understandable. That's, that's all there is to it. Because again, languages, we\ntend to forget that language is a means of communication. All those nasty comments that we got\non YouTube are a reflection of how society is built around performance. Or you're doing well,\nor you're doing poorly. No, you're communicating. That's the most important thing. But. People don't care about that, or\nit's not that people don't care. Most of the time, sometimes when I\nsee these comments, I think they're missing the forest for the trees. You know, this like anti fake polyglot\nthing, or you are polyglo Europe cares. If you speak 20 languages or 30, as\nlong as you enjoy using these languages in your lives at all, that counts. But I just want to stress this because\nthe way we judge others is also in a way, the way we judge ourselves. So we tend to think we have to\nperform well, we have to speak well. Yes, if you can speak a\nlanguage well, that's great. But if you communicate effectively,\nthat's even more important. That's my point. That's my opinion. And I think too, it's a\nmatter of what we want to do. So you pointed out that initially you\nhad trouble pronouncing it English and eventually you got better. And I know, for example,\nthere was this I think it was called anti moon or something. There was some kind of a\nlanguage community online. And so I got interested in Russian. So I recorded myself saying something\nin Russian, reading some Russian. And of course, my\npronunciation was terrible. These people just jumped on me. You're using, yeah, no good, whatever. And stop. A, don't criticize people who are trying\nto learn a language if their pronunciation isn't quite what you think it should\nbe or if they get something wrong. Like, I think anyone who's\nattempting to learn another language should always just be encouraged. And B, our pronunciation\nevolves and we get better. And I believe that we get\nas good as we want to be. So, I am sure that the French\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, he's happy with his French accent. Doesn't want to change it, but he\nuses his English very elegantly and he has achieved his goal. If he said, I want to speak English\nlike Luca Lampariello, he could work on it and he would get a lot closer. But it's not important. It's a matter of what\nhe or she wants to do. Like I mentioned, my father, my father\nwho spoke English, he could beat us and scrabble and yet he had his,\nthing because in Czech, you know, it's Nova Scotia, like he would always\nsay shoulder instead of shoulder. You know, well, would, would, could. Why is shoulder different? It should be shoulder, not shoulder. Yes. So there's a level of stubbornness there. But if I said dad. You should work on your, like, I would\nnever say that, my father, you should work on your English pronunciation,\nbut if people want to, they can start noticing, they can improve. But as you say, as long as we're\nable to communicate, we're there, that's good enough, and if you\nwant to refine it further, fine, go for it, but it's not necessary. I agree. And you made a very important point,\nwhich is in the form of a question. What is it that you want\nto do with this language? To me, language learning is mostly\nabout oral communication, but not only, like you, I love reading books about\nhistory, geography, the history of the country, but So for some other people,\nmaybe they just want to write in that language, or they want to read in that\nlanguage, then want to speak, or for them, maybe accent is not as important. So we tend to judge, you know,\nother people's performance, so to speak, based upon our own standards. Everyone is different. Everyone wants to do something\ndifferent with the language. And not every student wants\nto speak a language fluently. Maybe they just want to enjoy,\nI don't know, the grammar, the history, or just reading. So it's important to take\nthat into consideration when. You know, we think about what others\nare doing, which we should not do, by the way, and what we should\ndo when it comes to the language. Why do I want to learn this language? What do we want to do with this language\nis an even more profound question. That is really important, and if\nthe answer is, I don't know, then you should go back to the drawing\nboard and pick another language. That's my humble opinion. Right, but, and, and also, if you\nare mostly interested in reading in the language, that's legitimate too,\nor you want to understand movies. However, I believe that someone who\ncan read novels, Who can understand movies, if they want to speak, they\nwill be able to speak very well. Struggle at first, but\nthey'll be able to speak. I often hear, especially, I shouldn't\nsingle them out, but say Chinese people, they say, well, you know, I can read well. Like I, in Vancouver, I had dealings\nwith the Chinese immigrant community and they said, well, you know, we Chinese. They love to say, we Chinese, like I\nrepresent all the Chinese everywhere. But we Chinese, we can read\nwell, but we can't speak well. Do you read novels? No. So you can read a newspaper article\nwith difficulty, but that's not enough. Can you read novels? Can you understand audio books? Can you understand movies? If you have that level of\ncomprehension, you will speak. You cannot be C1 in comprehension. And B1 in oral proficiency. You may struggle at first, but\nyou very quickly can get there. Of course. If you, if you, if you speak,\nif you don't speak, of course, it's difficult to develop it. Of course. But your point is that if you're\nreading, listen, and you watch a lot, then it comes out very naturally. That's what happened to me. I was watching all these movies\nin English and one movie a night, every night in French. All of a sudden I was speaking French\nlike, Hey, where does this come from? And all of a sudden, you know, that\ncomes from movies, you know, all that. Input that I got. Absolutely. Like in my Persian learning or even\nTurkish learning, there might be a week or two go by before I speak to my tutor. And in the intervening period, I had been\ndoing a lot of listening and reading. And my tutor would say,\nwow, you've improved a lot. Have you been talking a lot? No, I've been listening and reading a lot. I mean, to speak well,\nwe have to speak a lot. I think you and I both agree. Yes. You have to speak a lot. So either you go to the country or\nyou have a group of, uh, whatever your Turkish friends in Rome and you go out\nevery night and eat kebab or something. But yeah, you know what I mean? Not every night, but. Yeah. No, but you have to speak a lot. There's no question. But if you don't have a vocabulary, if\nyou don't have that familiarity with the language, you won't be able to speak well. If you have the familiarity with\nthe language and then you get the opportunity to speak a lot, very\nquickly, you'll start speaking well. Right, right on the money. And in a chapter, I think it's chapter six\nor seven of the book, I talk about that. I. Started speaking with two tutors\nin Hungarian at the beginning. I didn't have that much input. And I just realized this is not going\nanywhere because I was rehearsing always the same, you know, sentences\nconversation, but the, you know, it might sound technical when we speak about\nacquiring a language versus learning a language, because fundamentally. It's the same thing, but\nit's not the same thing. Acquiring, you know, means to get\nthe language in you by exposure while learning is trying to scribble\ndown things or like remembering by rote, you know, just remembering\nwords and it's not the same thing. And the human brain learns much\nbetter by acquiring the language through massive exposure. That's the mistake I made\nbecause the thing is. Can't you do both? Yes, but the problem is we have, I don't\nknow about you, about Steve, about me, we have more time because, you know,\nit's our job, we like languages, it's our hobby, but a lot of people are busy. If you have 30 minutes a day, in my\nhumble opinion again, it's much better. You're much better off using\nthem to listen and read. Rather than trying to remember words\nor speak or write, you can do that. You can do these things on top. I talk about this language pyramid, right? Like at the base, we will show, we will\ntry to show you the language pyramid. I thought that was excellent\nin your book, by the way. Thank you. Um, yeah, I was, I was just trying to\nshow something because I was struck, uh, by this, uh, Pyramid of the food\nwhere the base is fruits and vegetables. And then I thought, okay, well, let\nme think about feeding your mind with language is the same concept. You listen and read, you read and\nlisten, you listen, you read, et cetera. That's the base that you can do some\noutput and then you can do some grammar. The thing that struck me the most. Is that the pyramid for most people who\ngo to school is actually the opposite. It's just people don't, it's inverted. They do grammar. They try to memorize words. And the scary part of this is that when\nyou tell them about this, they get shocked because the school system has not imposed,\nbut I would say just think about the, the, the, the bias that we have as human\nbeings, about all the things that will, you know, Taught us that we're not true. Mark Twain used to say that what gets you\nin trouble is not what you know, is that what you don't know, that is something\non those lines that when you think, you know, but it's not so, so you take\nthings for granted, they're not granted. And when students come to me or\nused to come to me as a coach, they went like, Oh, I don't have\nto learn grammar at the beginning. One student told me, I\ndon't have a grammar book. I still have to, you know,\nI always start with grammar. So you don't need that. He was shocked. He said, what, what, what do I do? I said, wait a second. I'm going to show you. It's just that it's, it's amazing\nthat if you show a person, this is why I like, uh, YouTube. I like education in general. You can share, you know,\nit's not lecturing people. It's just sharing. Hey. This is not just working for me,\nbut it's working for everybody because the brain is worked this way. The brain is, acquires\nlanguage through input. It's as simple as that. It's a simple reality, but it's\ndifficult to digest for most people because they were taught otherwise,\nwhich is a little bit sad, but I hope things are changing and will change. Now we both agree on\nthe importance of input. The overwhelming importance of input. So I want to bring up some areas\nwhere we have different techniques. And again, I refer to your book where\nyou explain to Richard Simcott, a wonderful polyglot, friend of ours,\nyour approach to language there and he's, and he called you Lupino. He said, that's wonderful. You know, nice to hear that, but\nI completely disagree with you. Or words to that effect,\nif I remember your words. Yes, yes. Which isn't true, of course, he doesn't\ncompletely disagree because he's also very much dependent on input. However, all successful polyglots\ndevelop their own specific techniques that are specific to them. I believe we all learn the same way. Our brains are constructed in the same\nway, but we have our likes and dislikes. For example, I recognize that if I were\nto write by hand, I would learn better. But I'm too lazy to write by hand. I have also seen your translation\ntechnique where you translate from the language into your own, from\nyour own back into the language. I also think that's\nprobably a good thing to do. I'm too lazy to do it. So can you talk to me about those\ntwo things, which I identified as being Luchino techniques that I\ndon't use, but which I, I agree with. If I had the discipline to do\nthose things, I would learn better. It's easier for me just to grab\nmy mp3 player and start listening. Sure thing. So we're opening a Canon warps\nand we don't have much time, but I'll try to be brief. I think one of the most important\nthings for everyone to learn a language efficiently is to find that gray\nzone, which is not gray at the day. It's, it's a green zone\nbetween efficiency. And enjoyment, something can be\nefficient and something can be effective, but if it's not something\nyou like, you're not going to do it. And on the other way around, if\nsomething is enjoyable, but it doesn't move the needle, so to speak,\nit's not going to move the needle. I think that the reason why language\nlearning is so fascinating is because there's universal principles, but\neveryone learns in a different way. So on the one hand, you have. You know, learning every day, exposing\nyourself to the language, et cetera. So the, let's say strategy, the\nGreeks will call it strategies. Beautiful word. And then you have tactics. Tactics is what you do every day. When you sit down and say,\nwhat is it that I actually. Like learning. So to make a long story short, when I\nstart learning a language, now I don't have it here, I have a lot of language\nbooks, but they're in the other room. What I do is I choose a book, Assimil,\nAssimil is what I start with, but it can be any book that is made of dialogues,\nreal language, and I translate it back and forth, meaning first I translate\nthe dialogue into my own native language by typing in a Google doc. People might say it's completely useless. You already have the translation. But you will see that the art\nof translating into your own language makes you notice. That's what counts. You will see that if you translate\nsomething, you have to understand it. You can't translate something\ninto your own native language. If you don't understand it. And then a few days later, I\ntranslate that back into my target language and that's testing. Testing without stress. So you test yourself for the\nsake of using something that is, okay, this is the solution and\nI'm trying to solve a problem. I really like Stephen Krashen. Uh, finished one of his, uh, books about\nlanguage learning as solving problems, learning to solve a linguistic problem. So it's a way of putting the puzzle\ntogether, not just trying to remember words, but trying to remember the\nmeaning that these words convey. Now, is this efficient? It is now I've explained\njust the basic step, but it's much more complex than that. It's made of multiple parts that,\nyou know, every day you do something different on a different net. The question is, and I always\nsay it, do you want to do this? If you like doing that, then great. You like translating, et cetera. If you don't like sitting and translating\nand you just can read, listen multiple times, do it in a different way. But the concept of reading\nand listening is always there. So just to make a long story\nshort, the principle is listening, reading, and understanding. You can't acquire language if\nyou don't understand a message. That's why translation,\ntranslation is making sure that you understand it and you absorb it. But again, you have to. Like it. So I always say, try this. Do you like it? Great. If you don't like it, you can test\nsomething else or extract the principles. In my courses at the Academy, we\nhave principles first learn these, because this is what really guides\nyou, makes, moves the needle. Once you understand the principles,\nthen you can bold and twist and tweak the principles so that you can create\nwhat works for you because language learning is something unique to you. I remember back in the day before the\ninternet, the internet era, I thought, Oh, this is the best method of the world. No, it's not. It's just one method that I came up\nwith that works really well with me. And it has been working very well\nfor those, those took the, the bidirectionalization course at my academy. But some people might say,\nI don't like this method. I want to try something else. And that's perfectly fine. This is the way for me to acquire,\nlet's say, a foundation in the language. For three months, I do\nthis back and forth thing. Then I hate it. Then I can't stand it because\nlanguage learning is something that moves all the time. Like, Transforms itself,\nyour skills change with time. So something you liked doing at\nthe beginning, maybe you don't like doing them the same way later. So for three months, I just spent these\nthree months, just imagine climbing this mountain, sweating, spending one\nhour, one hour, 15 minutes, learning the language, the hard way, sitting\ndown and trying to understand every nook and cranny of the language. I did this in January, 1st of January till\nthe 31st of March, 2024 with a Turkish. But then I just couldn't\neven look at Asimil anymore. And I told myself,\nokay, why did I do this? It's because this facilitates\nthe acquisition of language. Now that I have a good grasp of how\nthe language sounds, I went to LingQ. I went to, uh, YouTube. I downloaded podcasts and\nI could listen and read. without even grammar explanations because\nI understood the basics, so to speak. So for me, this learning, hard\nlearning, like deliberate learning is only conducive to acquisition. I can't wait to learn by acquiring\nthe language, not learning it. But this three month thing is for\nme necessary just to speed up things because I'm not in a hurry, but to\nunderstand things, because as you know, sometimes something that is really\nhard to do, it takes concentration, attention, then it's easier. I can relax. I can just, you know, listening\nto something and understand it. So it's a mix of deliberate and\nacquiring, depending on where I am. But again, everybody is different. I use this technique by\ndirectional translation. Then I moved on to basically just\nlistening and reading while listening. We're reading, while reading subtitles,\nwe're watching videos for the intermediate stage, massively, a huge amount of\npodcasts and videos using LingQ, using many resources, three or four normally. And then I just, you know, once\nI become a language user, I start reading and watching movies, et cetera. Now that leads me into then\nthe second part of my question, which was the handwriting. So when you do your translation, is that. Handwriting. And what do you think is the\nimportance or the benefit? What are the benefits of writing\nby hand versus writing on the computer or even not writing at all? Okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. So for me, the, the first three\nmonths, I'm just writing, um, Google doc because for me, it's faster to\ntype, but I'm also, I don't have it now, but I don't know where it\nis, but I also write a little bit. But it's in the second part after\nthree months, when I start listening to podcasts and watching videos\nthat are relying on writing. So what I do is normally I write on\na loose piece of paper, and then on Saturdays and Sundays, I transfer all\nthese words into these notebooks here. Now, I don't do it for\na long period of time. I do it maybe for six months, seven\nmonths, depending on things, and I try to make it as fun as possible. What is it that I do? I'm just going to give you an example. So whether it's YouTube videos,\nit's podcasts, or, and in particular conversations with a tutor, I'm\nsorry, my handwriting is terrible, but I'm just going to give you an idea. I write just when I relisten\nto the conversation, but this goes for podcasts as well. I first write something that's\ncalled episodic memory framework. This is basically a fancy word\nto say that all these pieces of information are related. What language are we looking at there? It's hard for me to make out. It's because of my handwriting. So on the one hand it's Greek here. This is Greek. Oh yes, I can see it. Yeah, yeah. I think it's mirrored. So this is Greek and the other\none is English because it's a corresponding sentence. Right. And these sentences are just, or\nchunks, I call them chunks, are just related to that one conversation. So this is like lesson five. This is like conversations\nwith Daria, number 10. This is the 10th notebook. Let me, let me show you here. I give it a label. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then I just write, for example,\nlet me see here, we are all together. A lot of interesting things can happen. I don't know if you know, to tell\nyou the truth, all these chunks. And then the amazing thing is that\nI remember this conversation because this episodic memory framework. And I can reenact the\nconversation just on Saturday. For example, I take this,\nI stand up and I talk. And what I do is that I rehearse words. I don't like rehearsing words\nfor the sake of rehearsing words. I always like using words\nwithin a specific context. And the thing is that people tend\nto think, for example, Oh, use mind maps, or you can maybe talk about\nall the animals like should have. I don't know. You learn all these words. I don't think that's very efficient. I think it's much more efficient to\ngroup these words into situations. You, for example, you learn, you can do\nthis a link, you learn those words and those expressions related to that one\npodcast that I learned that one day. So basically what I do is I tend to learn. In spurts and with podcasts and videos,\net cetera, and all these words, I just write, I like writing things down. I move things from one place to the other. So when I learn from a podcast, I\nwrite it on a loose piece of paper. Then on Saturday and Saturday and Sunday,\nwhen I have a little bit more time and energy, I pour them all into one space. And you can say, well, why don't\nyou put it in a spreadsheet? Why don't you put it in a Google doc? It doesn't work for me. When I handwrite, handwriting\nis a knack of creation. When you create your, or you craft your\nown word, it takes those two, three seconds that allow you to, the brain\nto internalize the words themselves. And I thought, I'm always wondering,\nwhy does this work so well? Why do I remember things much\nbetter when I handwrite them? I write them in chunks and I\nput them within a spreadsheet. You know, a specific topic. And then I looked up all these scientific\narticles and they all point to one direction that handwriting beats digital\ntyping tenfold or 10 times, but, but. I think we need both. The internet gives us, it makes\neverything available, gives us speed, but the, uh, handwriting\ngives us, uh, depth, so to speak. And so why not use both? I think there's some evidence too that\nthe actual physical activity of writing by hand connects to your brain in such\na way that helps with learning, so. Again, you asked me in the earlier\ndiscussion, if I had 60 days to learn a language, what would I do? Writing by hand would be a big part of it. Maybe even your translation technique. I'm a dilettante right now. So I'm, I do whatever's easiest\nfor me, which is just listening. However, if a person is determined\nto improve in the language is, is, You know, whether they have a test or\nwhatever, or they have set themselves specific goals, I'm quite sure\nthose techniques are very effective. Which brings me to my next question. You mentioned that your techniques evolve\ndepending on your stage in the language, or maybe what you like to do evolves\ndepending on your stage in the language. But over the years, since, say you\nwere 10 years old, to what extent have your techniques, given all of the\ntechnological change that has taken place, to what extent have your techniques,\nthe things that you like to do or the things that you consider effective, to\nwhat extent have they changed over the last, I'm guessing, 20 some odd years? It's a, it's an excellent question\nand my answer is not much. Meaning that the core of what\nI do hasn't changed at all. Listening, reading, etc. It's how I do with the changes in the\nsense that now we have these amazing tools that allow us, for example, to understand\nanything, uh, that we didn't have before. To give an example, if I had learned\nChinese, I don't know, say 30 years ago, I, it would have been a loss. Imagine in front of a Chinese\ntext with just these characters. And I use LingQ, which allow me to,\nyou know, just download the thing. And you could use, download\nthe whole transcript. I could use, for example, Google\nTranslate, or I could click on each word and it gave me directly the meaning. I could see the sentences. That was a game changer, but\nfundamentally they facilitated what I've already been doing. Human beings have been learning languages\nsince the dawn of time, as they say. 2, 000 years ago, 3, 000\nyears ago by speaking. But now we have the technology to make it. You know, to, to make\nit easier, I would say. So fundamentally not much until\n2022 when Chachapiti happened. And then you have all these AI tools\nthat allow you, for example, one thing I'm testing and I really like it is\nI'm talking to a machine 30 years ago. They would have told me that I\nwould have spent like 30 minutes, 60 minutes talking to a machine in Greek. I would have been strange, but that is\nalso making a difference for my Greek because I'm speaking with no stress. Even an experienced person, like\nI consider myself an experienced person when I come on an expert\nwhen it comes to language learning, second language acquisition. I have a certain degree of\nstress because I'm a human being. If I speak a language I don't speak\nwell, there's always a certain degree of stress or anxiety. I don't have that with speaking with AI. And also ChatGPT, the one thing that I've\nbeen using it a lot is, you can write and you can get immediate corrections. It can tell you also how to improve. What to say instead of, you know, you\ncan say this and you can say that. So I think AI will change, will not change\nfundamentally, will not change the way we acquire language, but it will facilitate\nthe process of learning languages. The one track that we should not\nfall into is to think, Oh, I'm just going to spend all my time\nspeaking with AI or just like doing. Just spending too much\ntime in the digital world. I think the language learning can\nalso, again, here with notebooks, writing, handwriting, talking to\npeople, it doesn't have to replace all those activities we've been doing. So to answer your question, I haven't\nchanged my way of learning over the last 20 years, but it has slightly\nimproved and it was AI in terms of getting feedback, especially\ngetting feedback without any tutor. I can do it anytime. Wake up at five, talk to the machine. Collect feedback, which I've been doing\nsome of these notebooks are, are AI conversations and my Greek is exploding\nin like two weeks, getting so much better because they corrects me all, Oh, you\nknow, you can say this in a different way. You, it gives me suggestions,\nnot only the mistakes, but also. Different ways of, you know, strings,\nstringing sentences together. So, so how, again, I'm\nnot that familiar with it. I know that we have a link. We're looking to introduce AI. We want to make sure we do it right. And the way that this, as you say, not a\ndistraction, but actually a net benefit. I have used AI in a variety of ways. AI can write a story for me. AI can give me 10 examples of a\nparticular grammar pattern in any language, and it comes up right away. It tends to give me the English\ntranslation, which I don't want, because I want to import it into LingQ. So then I go back and say,\nplease give me the 10 sentences without any English translation. And I get them, I import it into LingQ,\nyou can have a written conversation. I haven't yet spoken to ChatGPT. How do you do that? So I, I spoke with ChatGPT a little bit. You can, you can install the new voice. It's a, I think it's available in Canada. It's also in Europe, but I've\nbeen using another, um, another website, which is called Langua. I don't know if you ever heard of that. No. And it's not that I was skeptical, but\napart from LingQ, I don't think I've ever used any other app for language learning. And I said, Hmm. Let me think about that. So I started using this LenguaTalk and\nLengua, LenguaTalk is called this way and I was surprised because I could\nactually speak with the machine and the machine replied in practically real time. It gave me all the corrections. It gave me, you can click. It gives me also the different\nways of saying the same thing. And it replies with questions that. elicit a conversation,\ninteresting conversation. So I said, okay, well, and then gives\nme a feedback with PDF, et cetera. Thanks. I mean, this, you can build\nit probably with link as well, because it's based upon, you know,\nanother website that offers this service and it's a game changer. This is the next thing for people\nwant to improve their speaking. Cause I was just like, I\ncan't believe I'm doing this. And it's really efficient. And all the students at my school are\ntaking this and it's, it's surprising. It's, it's good. Yeah, well, I'm definitely\ngoing to look into that. You should try it. Langua, L A N G U. Langua or Languatalk. Yes. If you write Langua or\nLanguatalk, you will find it. And, uh, it's, it's, it's really good. I will have a look. One more thing. You talked a lot in\nyour book about mindset. Oh, initially you had a mindset\nthat you couldn't learn languages. Now you have a mindset. That you can learn languages. And of course, with every language\nthat you learn, you're confirming your confidence that you can do so. I would imagine therefore that there's\nonly been two changes in your mindset. A, the mindset that says you can't\nlearn, and then acquiring this mindset that you can learn, and\nthat's now permanently your mindset. Or has your mindset changed\nor evolved over time? That's question number one. And question number two is what can you\ntell people who I mean, beyond telling that you can do it, you can do it. The person whose mindset is basic. I'm never going to become fluent. Like what can you say to\nthat person to, to help them? So the answer to the first question, I\nwould say my mindset has changed in the sense that when I was 14, well, 13, uh,\nor 12, actually, to be more precise, was 1993 when I started working with\nSusan, I thought I would never learn. A foreign language. Now that I speak a few, I know\nfor a fact that this is possible. Now, the interesting thing is that a lot\nof people tend to answer with, Oh, you must be a genius, you must be talented. And there's, um, um, A big danger to\nthat statement, because if you say that someone is, or you think for that matter. That someone is a, is talented, then\nyou put yourself automatically into the category of non, on the non talented. The one thing I've discovered, I think\nit's a, it's a universal truth is that if you speak your own native language,\nwell, that's not guaranteed because you might have some sort of impairment, but\nif you speak your own native language, well, you can learn or any other language\nbecause the human brain is equipped to deal with and learn as many languages as\npossible, as many languages, you can get the limits are time and space, obviously,\nbecause we're mortals and we sooner or later, we had to leave this planet. But you can learn as many\nlanguages as possible. Now, for those who come to me and say,\nyou know, you, these are just words you've learned because you're talented. I would say that it's important to trust\nthe process and to be flexible and to try. I still remember this when I was so\ndesperate that I, this is a memory that got, you know, even now, 30\nyears ago, this happened 30 years ago. I tried to ride a bike for the first time. I couldn't. My father said, patience, my\nboy, you're going to get there. And I tried and I tried and I tried\nand I stumbled and I fell, et cetera. After two or three days of hell, I just\nrealized, magic was to remember the day, Oh, I can actually ride a bike. And I think with language learning is,\num, nowadays we have a lot of knowledge. I think the trusting the process\nmeans to listen to people. Sure. Steve, Luca, and everybody else. Get what works for you, try things\nout and continue trying to learn. And most of all, as we always say,\nlearn, listen, and read, read and listen, combine these two watch\nstuff that you're interested in. I always say the fundamental rule, if you\nwant to see results is first trust the process and second, trust the process. Read, listen, read, or listen and\nwatch stuff that is understandable, interesting, and slightly higher than\nyour level so that it's not discouraging. If you do that sooner or later,\nthe magic will happen, meaning that you will get the language in you\nand then you will start speaking. Yes. It won't be easy. It won't be magic that all of a\nsudden you start speaking fluently. You will struggle at first,\nbut then you will get there. And it's one last thing I wanted to say. It's like climbing a mountain. Instead of thinking constantly\nabout the peak of the mountain, you see the snow as beautiful\never as you're going to get there. Focus on, you know, an off turn\naround and look at the landscape. Focus on the stretch\nyou've covered so far. Most people focus on what is ahead. Instead of thinking what\nis, what they've covered. I mean, that's also something that\nyou say in your book and which made me think of the book Atomic Habits. And that is that you have to focus\non your daily activities rather than focusing on sort of long term goals. I mean, the long term goals are nice\nto have, but you have to set yourself some short term goals in terms of\nthe amount of time you're going to spend on different activities. Part of doing that is, as you\nsay, believing in the process. Enjoying the process. You have to have that feeling. I want to be doing what I'm doing now. I am glad, even though it's not\nevident that I'm getting anywhere, but I enjoy doing what I'm doing. So I think that's also\npart of that mindset. Believing yourself, but also believing\nthat you're doing something worthwhile. You're doing something that you value. You're doing something that you enjoy. All of those things. I guess to some extent you either\nhave that attitude or you don't. I'm not sure how you can convince someone\nthat doesn't enjoy language learning Doesn't think they're going to get\nanywhere, but once they overcome that obstacle and they convince themselves\nthat they can learn, that they enjoyed the learning process, that they\nfound a process that they enjoy, then after that, there's no looking back. I agree. That's the reason why I say the\nflexibility, open mindedness is really important because if\nyou're open minded, you're okay. I don't have this mindset,\nbut I might get it. Uh, there's a, I don't know if\nyou ever heard of Carol Dweck. She talks about mindset. Her book is about mindset and you\ncan apply to anything in life. Yeah. And Mindset about also gold Creating\ngoals, that's the same thing. I talk about this in the, in the book,\npeople tend to think that goals are, Hey, I want to be fluent in three weeks,\nbut this doesn't really move the needle. Instead, if you think, what is it that\nI have to do every day to get there? Well, think about, Hey, I want to\nimprove my listening comprehension. You don't have control over goals,\nbut you do have control over what you do every day, over the process. Exactly.\n15 minutes a day. Okay. I can listen to stuff and then eventually. I will get there and people, I\nbelieve that this has been my experience as a teacher, as a coach. That once you shift, you have this mind\nshift, you experience this mind shift between, okay, I'm not going to focus on\ngoals and performance or results anymore. I'm going to focus on what I can\ndo with the here and now every single day that changes everything. And that is part of your mindset. Absolutely. I agree. Last question, because you mentioned\nAI, so people often now come to me and say, well, you know, Steve, nobody's\ngoing to have to learn languages in the future because you can go to Vietnam and\ntalk to your computer and AI is going to make it unnecessary to learn languages. So. Luca's view on how technology is going to\nchange language learning, the importance of language learning, or things having\nto do with how people learn languages and their motivation to learn languages. That's a philosophical question. So on the one hand, as I, as I said\nbefore, I think it's going to facilitate language learning if we know how to learn,\nbecause there's still a lot of people who don't know, but if you know how to learn\nand you use the tools that we have, then. I think AI and we've, we've been talking\nabout AI and chat GPT 2022, but the reality is we've been working with AI\nover the last 10 years, what we can do with translators, deep L Google translate\nlink, everything AI is embedded in that. So on the one hand, I think if you\nknow how to use it and you don't, don't get sucked sucked in the\nrabbit hole of technology is great. I'm going to use just technology and\ngoing to get lost in that dungeon. Then it's a great weapon. If you want to call it weapon in your\narsenal, in your learning arsenal. On the other hand, though, I think\nit's our personal, it's up to us to decide what to do with it. Again, it comes down to your mindset. So a person can say, I don't need to learn\nEnglish because I can have a translator. I can use a phone and I can talk to a\nVietnamese by, you know, by means of, you know, Translation and whatever, another\nperson would say, well, I want to, I will learn this language because it's\nnot just about the words and the grammar. I think that every language you\nlearn, it changes you in the fundamental way that you don't know. You realize it later. Oh, this language has changed me. So I think it's very valuable for a lot\nof reasons, for obvious reasons, such as you can find or travel around the world. You can talk to people. It's easier to communicate. But it may changes you, it makes\nyou understand, and this might sound trivial, but it's not at all. It makes you understand. We're all very similar. Human beings, very similar. We tend to think, look at differences. Oh, that guy is black, white, thinks in\na different way, eats different stuff. Fundamentally, you want the same things\nand you understand it through language. So language changes you as\na person, makes you richer. And it's always, always worth learning. And no matter how many translators\nwe have, no matter how many machines can speak in our, our\nstead, it has been my experience. I can tell you that after learning. 15 languages, you'll learn even more. You are a richer person. You are more open to the world. You understand it from other\nperspectives, something that a monolingual will never be able to do. And I don't remember who said that some\nwise man from the past, you know, if you know another language, it helps you\nunderstand your own language, it gives you a different perspective of the world. So it's always, I think it will depend\non the, on the single individual and they want to learn language. They have a certain mindset, want\nto learn a language to improve themselves for self growth. Great. They want to use all the available,\nthe, the AI tools that we have now. They can also do that, but I don't see\nthis, I don't see language learning dying. No, I agree with you. And I think that's a good,\na good note to end on. And I mean, the reality is like\ncommunicating doesn't just mean asking for directions to the bathroom. Yes, that's exactly right. You know what I mean? It's not just like, uh, beers, please. I mean, communicating is, if\nyou sit down at a table, we're talking Vietnamese, okay? I'm sitting on these little low slung\nchairs on the sidewalk eating your fur. And if you're with Vietnamese\npeople, you wanna be talking, communicating, connecting. Maybe you're sitting beside this\nnice looking girl at the bar. You don't wanna be talking into your\nphone, you wanna talk to her, you know? So, yeah, I think, uh, I agree with you. Language learning will only be\nfacilitated by technology, AI. It's not going to be\nreplaced by those things. Although those people have a very sort\nof instrumental attitude towards language communication, like show me the way to the\nbathroom, they will undoubtedly rely on their telephone, but people who genuinely\nwant to communicate and understand, people of a different culture, AI is\nonly going to facilitate that for them. Luca, can you please tell my\nlisteners where they can find you? So it's all the different possible. Yes, it's very easy. You just type on Google Luca Ello. You will find my website, which is luca\nello.com, or you can write Luca Ello. L-U-C-A-L-A-M-P-A-R-I-E-L-L-O. It's easy though, Ello you,\nyou see it as you write it. And they will also find\nmy YouTube channel. Luca lampel.com is the website\nwhere I also have my academy, the courses, the blog, and uh, book. And they can also find\nthe book that you read. And this is not a website for\nlearning Italian specifically. It's a website for learning\nhow to learn languages. Yes. It's called Smart Language Learning\nAcademy because it's an academy where we have online courses to\ntrain people to use their brain to learn languages more effectively. We've talked about a few things here, but\nwe go much more in depth about techniques, strategies, and of course, principles. Okay. Thank you, Luca. I recommend that people go there and get\nto know more about, uh, your methods. And it's been a great, uh,\ndiscussion and I look forward to the next time we meet in person. Always a pleasure to talk to you, Steve. Bye. Okay. Bye bye."

        "title": "How to use YouTube to boost your language skills",
        "transcript": "Hi, today I want to talk about\nYouTube, which I consider to be the new university in many senses and\nthe ideal place to learn languages. And this is in response to some pushback\nI got from my last video, where I said we shouldn't focus on the language\nclassroom as a place to learn and people said, well, yeah, but, uh, in\nthe case of Canada, we have this core French, which has to be taught, we're\nobliged to teach it, the teachers are, but What, what are you going to do? How are you going to teach core French? Or in the case of Japan, a lot of students\nare not very motivated to learn English. All of which I recognize, but the\nnet result is of the current teaching practices is that a very small percentage\nof students end up speaking the language. So whatever is being done is\nactually not being very effective. I can speak. With more confidence about what happens\nin Canada than in the situation in Japan. So in my view, if I were responsible\nfor the core French program in English speaking Canadian schools, I would begin\nby telling the students in my program this year and for the next three years. The coming years, you are not going\nto be required to remember anything. You are not going to be\nrequired to learn anything. You are simply going to expose\nyourself to the language. You're going to listen. You're going to watch movies. You're going to read. We're going to maybe\ntalk in the classroom. I'm here to answer questions. I'm here to help you find things of\ninterest for you to listen to and read and watch, but you're not going\nto be required to remember anything. So if you see a word that helps you\nget through the meaning of a sentence, Then I'm sort of reminded of Zhuangzi's\nparable of the fishnet, which I can't remember the words exactly, but\nI'll put it up on the screen here. But the gist of it is once the\nfisherman has caught a fish, he doesn't need his fishnet anymore. So you use a word to get through the\nmeaning of whatever you're reading, and then you forget about it. You haven't forgotten it,\nbut you can't recall it. It's in your brain somewhere. And just keep on catching fish,\ngetting rid of the net, learning words, forgetting about them. Worrying about whether you\ncan test on them, not worrying about if you can use them again. It doesn't matter. You have to get used to that sense of\nlistening to things you don't understand, learning words and forgetting them, but\nsomehow trying to find a way to enjoy it. So that would be sort of my introduction. YouTube, I make specific reference to\nYouTube because I think YouTube, as I say, is the new university, the origin\nor the etymology of the word university comes from meaning the whole, universitas,\nwhich refers Referred to a whole community of professors and scholars or teachers\nand learners, which is what YouTube is. YouTube is a community of people teaching\neach other, learning from each other. Anyone can teach, anyone can learn. When I need to figure out how to\ndo something, like I was going to wash my windows here at home, and I\nthought, you know, maybe I've been doing it wrong all these years. I'll look up on YouTube and sure\nenough, there's any number of videos providing sort of technique\non how to better wash windows. And that's what I did. I washed my windows with a technique\nthat I had learned on YouTube. And I was assembling a bicycle the\nother day and I looked it up on YouTube. And fortunately I did because the left\npedal, the thread, as I'm assembling the pedal has a left handed thread,\nwhich makes sense when you think about it afterwards, but unless\nyou're thinking about it, you might try very hard to get it to turn. You know, the right handed thread. Uh, anyway, small details, but\nYouTube, great source of information. First thing that people can do if the\nkids are willing to accept the fact that they just have to listen, just expose\nthemselves, watch cartoons, watch movies, don't worry what they can remember. And I would even suggest to students, step\nnumber one, go to YouTube and look up. People like Luca Lappagiello\nor Lucca, other people who talk about how to learn languages. There's so many of them. Expose yourself to it, forget it. Watch someone else, forget it. Get a sense of what language\nlearning is all about. Because, you know, someone who's\nin the core language curriculum, French curriculum in Canada,\nor learning English in Japan. They're going to be added\nfor quite a few years. So they probably would benefit from having\nsome sense of how language learning works and that's best found on the internet. And I'm referring specifically to YouTube. Now, the next thing is kids in\nSweden who watch cartoons, they're interested in their cartoons. They're not interested\nin learning English. They're interested in cartoons. So the trick is. How to find things of interest. I find it demotivating when the\nteacher says, read this or watch this or listen to this, because I,\nthe teacher find it interesting. That's not interesting to me, the learner. So the teacher in my program\nof core French has to help me. The learners and encourage the learners\nto go and find things of interest to them. Sports, cartoons, music, songs. It doesn't matter. In fact, when we say things of interest\nto them, I would even go as far as to say in other languages, explore YouTube. Now we can talk about YouTube in the\nclassroom and how to make sure that the, uh, students are on safe sites, call it. And so that's a whole other technical\nissue, which I won't get into, but there are ways of dealing with that. But the point is. And as I've explained many times,\nanything that's on YouTube with subtitles or even without subtitles can\nbe imported into a website like LingQ. And I have done this. I'm going to show you this in French\nand someone who's working on their French can go in there Find these\nvideos on a variety of subjects and bring them in and learn from them. Another use of YouTube\nis points of grammar. Now, I'm not big on teaching grammar\nupfront, but what tends to happen after a while is if you've heard certain patterns\nin the language, you become curious. You think you can Maybe focus in\non it a little bit and improve. And there is no shortage, if we're\ntalking about French, of language instruction in French on the internet,\nbut the same is true for other languages. And again, I would encourage\nthe students to go on the internet, go on YouTube rather. Specifically, and go find videos\nof interest to you about how the language works, about the articles\nor the possessive or the gender, anything you want, just go there. It's all there. Look it up. Have any questions come to me. And if you can't find those\nkinds of YouTube videos, then our channels, I will help you find them. Now, if, uh, from the\nperspective of a teacher. There are all kinds of videos on how to\nuse YouTube in the language classroom. Because after all, this is this\nuniversity, YouTube university, it's a whole community of teachers and learners. And the teachers can also\nlook up how other teachers are using YouTube in the classroom. It was pointed out, for example, that\nif you recommend a video to the student, you can actually help the student. Start in at seven minutes and 15 seconds,\nif there's a way of doing that so that they only see that segment of that video. But I would steer clear of the\nidea that this teacher tells the student what to listen to. It's gotta be the student exploring\nYouTube and finding content in the target language so that they explore,\nthey get in the habit of looking for things of interest to them. And if they find things. they're more likely to find\nthings of interest to them. I believe that if the teacher says, this\nis important, you should know about, you know, environmentalism or whatever\nit is the teacher's interested in or classical literature or any number of\nthese things, that the teacher thinks, perhaps with good reason, but these\nthings are important for the student to learn, but that's not what it's about. It's about the language. And therefore the student should be\nencouraged to find things of interest to them and just let it wash over them. Um, listening, because all of this is\ncontributing to a sense of the language. Another thing we can do with YouTube\nis have the class make videos, either individual videos of them speaking\nand say French or English, which can be part of their kind of portfolio of\nwho they are in this other language, or the class can make videos together. And it's all part of participating in\nthis community of learners and learners. Teachers, and of course, if they make\nvideos, they can share these with friends, uh, in the case of Canada,\nuh, perhaps, uh, students in Vancouver or in British Columbia or in Alberta. Ontario can make videos in French,\nwhich they share with students in Quebec who could then make,\nmaybe make videos in English, which they then send back to them. One of the things I discovered in,\nin looking up this subject of, uh, using YouTube in the classroom is a\nvery interesting video by this, uh, YouTuber called Genevi\u00e8ve Avelet. Who talks about her passion\nfor teaching Quebecois French. And I found a number of videos on\nthe subject of Quebecois French. Now, if we are talking about the\ncore French curriculum in Canada, we are talking in a Canadian context\nabout Quebecois or French Canadian, but typically Quebecois French. Unfortunately in Canada, there has\nbeen a tradition of Thinking that somehow Quebecois French is a sort\nof lesser version of French compared to the Parisian, call it French. And so this creates in the minds of\nthe learners, a sense that they're learning something that is less\nvaluable than the sort of call it the international version of French. It's not unexpected that the language\nspoken by 6 million people, uh, will be considered less somehow valuable than\nthe version of the language spoken by spoken by more than 60 million people. And even more if we look at, uh,\nsecond language learners of French. However, if the objective is to\ncreate or to help learners develop a positive attitude about what they're\nlearning in the context of Canada. Then they should be encouraged to look\nat some of these videos to understand how French spoken in Quebec is different,\nwhy it is that way, and hear that from people who are proud of that version of\nFrench and who want to encourage others to like that version of French, because a\nmajority of people who learn core French in Canada may have to interact with. People in Quebec. And so therefore it's in their interest\nto learn Quebecois French, or at least to understand how Quebecois French\nis different from, but not in any way inferior to the French spoken in France. Now, the learner in Vancouver may\nstill prefer the French spoken in France, may prefer to learn Spanish. And I think it's very\nimportant not to impose. Any value on the learner, not that the\nFrench from France is better, nor that the French from Quebec is better, uh,\nnor that as a Canadian where French is an official language, they are obliged to\nlearn French rather as much as possible to facilitate exploration and particularly\nusing YouTube as such a wonderful community of teachers and learners. Where you can learn how\nto fix your toaster. You can learn how to wash your windows. You can learn languages. You can learn how to learn languages. You can learn how to help\nothers learn language. There is no limit to what you can learn. And you can look these things up\nin the target language, in the language that you are learning. And when you find a video that\nyou like, make sure you turn on the subtitles in that same target\nlanguage, and you can then import it into a link and it becomes a lesson. And so I'll show you here. For example, I imported\na few of these things. And if I were so motivated, I could\ngo in there and acquire new words and maybe some Quebecois expressions. With these videos that I've found on my\nown, the key being that I am the one who is exploring with the guidance, with the\nencouragement, with explanation, with feedback, with help from the teacher. So, and I think the same can be done\nin Japan with regard to English. Again, as I said, and if the learner is\nmore interested in Chinese, then they should be helped to find content in\nChinese or Korean or whatever language they are more interested in learning. Use this community of teachers and\nlearners, professors and students, as an opportunity to encourage and\nenable people to step outside their own little world, explore on their\nown, develop a taste for learning and, and, and, and, You know, people may\nsay, Steve, you're very unrealistic. Most kids aren't interested in anything. You know, this whole negative thing,\nwhich I haven't found to be the case, but majority of language students and\nlanguage tests are not so motivated. However, my approach,\nno test, no pressure. You're not required to learn\nanything or remember anything. You're just going to be\nexposed to the language. At some point, some of these people\nmay become motivated when they can learn in a more deliberate way. But in any case. What we are now doing, at least in\nCanada, where 6 percent of anglophones outside Quebec can speak French. That number of people probably went\nto French immersion, have a parent or a relative who speaks French, has had\nsome other exposure to French, in other words, the actual teaching system in the\nschools is not serving them very well. So it might be worthwhile\nlooking at this other option. Thank you for listening. Bye."

        "title": "STOP doing these 7 things to START crushing your language goals",
        "transcript": "Hi. Language learning. That's what I talk about\nonce a week on this channel. Language learning is a huge market. Uh, depending on where you go on\nthe internet, there's all kinds of different numbers about the\nsize of the language learning industry or the size of that market. 60 billion in 2023, going\nto grow to 300 billion. People spend a lot of\nmoney on language learning. That means a lot of people want to learn. Languages, a lot of people, depending on\nwhere they are and the number of other circumstances aren't so very successful. I was going to mention, by the way,\nspeaking of language learning, my buddy Luca Lamporiello, who wrote this\ngreat book that he sent me and I read through it, he and I are going to have a\ndiscussion where we're going to talk about language learning because it's something\nthat we're both very interested in. But in my last video, I talked about how\npeople in Japan were suddenly saying, Oh, you know, our results in our tests of\nEnglish are poorer than they have been. And TOEIC, for example,\nJapan is well down the list. And I pointed out that it's not very\ndifferent in Canada when it comes to English speaking Canadians and their\nability to speak French, even though it's an official language in Canada. And the reasons have to do with motivation\nand with, uh, the way the language is taught and so forth and so on. So I thought I would come up with. What I would call my seven stops,\nhow to go about changing the way we approach language learning so that\nwe can finally get some results. Remember too, that the situation of\nsomeone in Japan or an English speaking Canadian in Vancouver is very different\nfrom that of someone in Europe, say, or in an area of the world where people are\nsurrounded by many different languages. And so it's easy to hear these languages. It's easy to turn on the television set\nand hear them in the original language. You can jump on a train or get in\nyour car and drive across the border to another place nearby where you\ncan speak a different language. That's a different situation. But when you're in English\nspeaking North America or you're in Japan, it's much more difficult. to have an opportunity to\nhear the language, to speak in the language you're learning. So what should the approach be? So I want to talk about some things\nI thought of initially for the situation in Japan, which I know well\nbecause I lived there for nine years. But I then realized that these things\napply generally because we all have the same, Same brain, basically. Now, obviously our native language\nconditions, our brain in a certain way. If we read Chinese characters, or if we\nread a language like English, where the relationship between the letters and\nthe sounds is not so obvious, generally kids take longer to learn to read. Whereas in languages like\nTurkish, which I recently was. You know, involved with, or, uh, you know,\nSpanish, it's a one to one relationship. So there are differences in the way\nthe brain deals with these languages, but the basic principles are the same. We listen, we hear, we, uh,\nconvert sound to meaning. If we read, we then have a code\nthat converts those signs on a piece of paper or on a screen into an\nequivalent phonic representation. And we take it down through. And we get meaning from that all the\nsame, doesn't matter where you live. However, in some parts of the world,\nyou're in a better position to learn or you're more motivated to learn. So seven things that we should stop doing. Number one, stop taking tests. And I say this in particular\nwith reference to Japan, where the TOEIC or IELTS, these,\nthese are enormous industries. People take the tests far too often. They have poor results. I see no benefit in taking a test\nthat proves that you're very weak. In the language, and yet these tests\nbecome the overwhelming sort of objective of language instruction to pass the test. And even within many language textbooks,\nwe're constantly being tested. And this is essentially wrong. And there's all kinds of evidence, both\nanecdotal and research that shows that where people expose themselves to just\na massive flow of the language, input, listening, reading, building up those\nhabits in the brain, in Japanese, we would Getting used to the language. That's far more effective than trying\nto focus in on, you know, testing you for your results because ultimately\nthe testing saps your confidence. It makes you nervous about the language\nand it really doesn't tell you anything. If you have a large vocabulary and\nyou have lots of experience with the language, you will eventually\nbe able to produce the language. The only test I ever took for a language\nwas, other than my French at school, the British foreign service exam for\nMandarin Chinese, because my Employer, the Canadian government required that of\nme, but all the other languages, I have never taken a test and I have no interest\nin taking a test, not in Spanish, not in Chinese or Korean or, or anything else. Second stop, stop going to language class. It's not necessary. It's expensive. It's not very effective in terms of. Use of time. You have to go there. You have to sit in class. It might be fun. You have your friends there. You have a teacher who inspires you. Perhaps it's motivating. I'm not saying that for an unmotivated\nlearner, that it isn't a good thing to do. But if you are motivated, we learn in\nour brains, we learn wherever we are. We live in a world where we can take our\nlanguage content with us wherever we are. Listening, reading,\nfinding people to talk to. The major focus of our language learning\nshould be outside the classroom. Not inside the classroom. Number three, and again, I thought\nof this with specific reference to Japan, but it applies to all of us. Stop connecting the way your writing\nsystem is pronounced to the pronunciation of the language you're learning. This is an extreme problem in\nJapanese to the extent that Japanese people use Katana. Which is one of the phonetic\nsystems in Japanese. To the extent that they use that\nphonetic system to learn other languages, they get horrible results. Because in, you know, if you take a\nword like clerk, for example, then in Katakana there is no RK sound. So it's krak, krak. That's all they have. That's the phonetic system. And I, I've often mentioned this before. My father, Who was originally from\nCzechoslovakia, he would say Shulda, or he would say Nova Scotia rather\nthan getting used to what the writing system of the language you are learning,\nhow it relates to pronunciation, and that has to be learned initially by. Perhaps some explanation, but more than\nthat, massive listening and reading. Whenever I start a new language, I\ndon't spend a long time on the values of the letters in the language. I kind of gloss over it. Maybe go back if I have some\nquestions, but more than anything, I listen and read and I accept how\nthe writing system is connected to pronunciation in that language. So don't connect your own writing\nsystem and the values of letters in your own writing system to the\nlanguage, to the pronunciation of the language you are learning. So next stop obsessing over grammar. Stop obsessing over the details\nof the language, especially at an early stage of your learning. You know, adventure and\nlearning a new language. A lot of these grammar explanations,\nyou won't be able to remember them. You won't be able to apply them. You don't even understand\nthem until you've had enough experience with the language. Treat grammar as additional, you know,\nside commentary on the language, but that's not where you're going to learn\nthe language and particularly don't worry about being tested on it and get it wrong. It doesn't matter. You need so much exposure\nto the language before it's. Starts to become a part of you. Number five, stop with the role playing\nor in the case of Japan, Eikaiwa, where learners sit around and talk to each\nother with a limited range of vocabulary. In particular, this role playing, you're\ngoing to pretend you're in some scenario situation where you have to come up\nwith words and express yourself in what is actually an artificial situation. You're far better off to spend your\ntime allowing your brain to assimilate the language, get used to the language. Rather than putting yourself in this\nsituation where you're basically rehashing the limited vocabulary that you have. Next thing again, particularly in Japan,\nbut even here in North America, stop feeling badly about what you can't do. Great panic in Japan. Oh, our performance, uh, you\nknow, 63 percent of kids, middle school kids can't speak English. Of course they can't speak English. They have no opportunity to speak English. Of course they're not\ngoing to speak English. They have to get used to English. English, which has. Compared to Japanese, different\nword order, very little in the way of common vocabulary. They have to get a lot\nof that language in them. And so obsessing over your inability\nto retrieve words, to understand words, all of that is self defeating. You need confidence. You need to enjoy the language. So stop beating yourself up over things\nthat you can't do in the language. Focus instead on things that\nyou can do in the language. And particularly if you find\nways to enjoy the language. That's where your focus should be. The next stop is stop memorizing. How much can you memorize? You can't memorize, for example, on my\nstatistics at LingQ, I have whatever it might be, 30, words in different languages\nthat I've learned at LingQ that I have acquired naturally, that I have acquired\nthrough massive listening and reading. And gradually these words have become a\npart of my initially passive vocabulary. A smaller subset become part of my\nactive vocabulary, but I haven't deliberately memorized them because\nyou can only memorize so much. And every time you're memorizing,\nyou're memorizing off a list, whether it be a list for TOEIC or whether it\nbe an Anki deck, you're learning words or trying to learn words in isolation. Whereas we know from research that\nwe are better able to retain words when we encounter these words. in different contexts so that we start\nto acquire the ability to anticipate what's going to happen in the language. That's how we acquire words. That's how we acquire the language,\nwhich reminds me, by the way, that when I talked about the obsessive\nfocus on grammar, all of my experience when I was teaching English at\nLingQ is the issue is not grammar. The issue is word usage, developing\nthat natural ability to know which word is used in which situation. Situation together with which other\nword that encompasses the sense of correct usage, call it grammar, but\nit comes through massive exposure to the language, not by studying\nlists of words in isolation or obsessing over rules of grammar. Trying to remember the rule\nis not going to enable you to understand or to speak well. Having a large vocabulary\nnaturally acquired is going to help you eventually speak better. So with all of these stops,\nwhat should we start doing here? You know, I was very gratified to\nsee there are a number of articles on the internet about the power of\nextensive reading Extensive reading as opposed to intensive reading. There's far too much emphasis on\nintensive reading in other words Analyzing what you read trying to infer\nwhat you read Analyzing it for grammar teachers who are trying to teach you\ncritical thinking all of this focusing in dwelling on With great intensity\non small bits of reading to my mind. In fact, the experience has demonstrated. This is not as effective as\nallowing readers and learners to choose what to read and listen to. I definitely would combine both the\nreading and the listening because they are very much connected in our brains and\ncombining the two helps us connect the sound with the way the word is written. And if we focus on imbibing as\nmuch of the language as possible. Allowing learners, great\ndiscovery, extensive reading. Let the learner choose what to read. That's like, wow, of course the\nlearner should choose what to read. It shouldn't be up to\nthe teacher to dictate. Far too often, teachers who assign\nreading, especially in ESL, but not only, they tend to bring in subjects\nof interest to them, social justice issues or environmental issues or Things\nlike this, which are maybe wonderful in and of themselves, but may not be\nwhat the learner is interested in. Let the learner choose\nwhat to read and listen to. And therefore, for example, if\nlearners are learning English, they needn't only learn from, say,\nAmerican culture or UK culture. They can learn about German culture\nor Chinese culture in English. In other words, English has, is such an\ninternational language, people should be using material that's of interest to them. It doesn't have to connect\nto the country of origin. That's in the case of English,\nalthough that might still be preferred by most learners. Fine. But if the learner prefers other\nkinds of material, they should be encouraged to use that kind of\nmaterial, material of interest to them. And, and by extension, and I'm looking at\nthe example of Canada, rather than forcing everyone to learn French because it's\nan official language, or in the case of Japan, forcing everyone to learn English\nbecause it's the language of international communication, maybe we just let people. Choose the language they want to learn. And that's much more possible today. We have 50 languages at LingQ. They are all learned\nthe same way at LingQ. Choose the language you're interested in. If you are motivated to learn that\nlanguage, you want to go to that country, or you want to connect\nwith that language, then do that. Because anyone who learns one second\nlanguage, third language, will have an easier time eventually of learning. So if the goal, for example, in Canada is\nfor English speakers to learn French, if that English speaker starts by learning\nChinese or Spanish, eventually they'll have an easier time learning French. Similarly, say in Japan, if a Japanese\nlearner is more interested in Korean or Chinese or Indonesian, and they\nlearn that language, when they go back to their English learning, because for\nwhatever reason, they're more motivated to do that, they will also have. A better time and an easier\ntime learning that language. So there you have it. My shock treatment, seven stops and one\nstart when it comes to language learning."

        "title": "10x your vocabulary growth with this language challenge",
        "transcript": "Hi there, Steve Kaufmann here. Today I want to talk about perhaps one\nof the most powerful things you can do to dramatically improve your level in a\nlanguage, and that is read a book from cover to cover on paper, and I'm going\nto talk a bit about my own experience and the things you can do to make that happen. Now, reading a book is not expensive,\nlike I happen to have here, a book in Turkish, Turkish history book. Unfortunately, it's too difficult for me. There's too many words\nthere that I don't know. I kind of get a sense and I can\nlisten to the audio book, but I can't really understand the book. And so in order to enjoy the experience\nof reading a book, you have to have, you know, 90, 95 percent of the words that\nyou can at least take a decent guess at. And so that requires a\ncertain level in the language. Okay. But by the same token, when\nyou do that, that's proof of where you are in the language. I still remember when I was\nstudying Mandarin Chinese and after six months, I read Loto Xiangzi,\nwhich is a very famous book. The Rickshaw Boy takes place in Beijing. It was very much part of my whole, you\nknow, connecting to this Chinese world. I enjoyed it. I missed a lot of words. There were no audio books at that time. I didn't have a digital\nversion of that book. I struggled through it, but\nI felt very proud of myself. I got confidence from having\ndone that up until that point. I had simply read either articles or\nchapters in readers, which had a lot of, uh, vocabulary lists in behind them. But here I was on my own, just me in\nthe book, great sense of achievement. You know, in German, I remember I\nread a book, uh, on environmentalism written by a German author. And again, having fought my\nway through the book gave me a great sense of satisfaction. Now, the thing about a book\nis books are not expensive. You can even borrow them from the library. What's required is your motivation\nand a certain level in the language. And when I look at the amount of money\nthat is spent on language learning and the amount of hand wringing that goes on\nin some countries, For example, someone showed me a website saying that, you\nknow, English level in Japan is declining and, and, you know, the numbers of people\nwho speak English in Japan, depending on what you read on the internet is anywhere\nfrom 3 percent to 30%, even saw one suggestion that the average English level\nin Tokyo is a B2, which of course is. Absolute nonsense, B2 is a very\nhigh level in order to have B2. You've got to be able to read a novel away\nfrom any, you know, online dictionaries. So that is not true. I often have people tell me, you know, I\nread well, but I just don't speak well. I don't really believe. I think if a person is reading\nnovels, they are acquiring. Or have a level of vocabulary and\nfamiliarity with the language, which means that given the opportunity to\nspeak, they will speak and you hear all these things, well, you know, the\nJapanese are not good at languages because they're not risk takers and stuff. You don't need to be a risk taker. If you have enough of the language\nin you, if the brain has gotten used to the language, Through\nmassive input, it's not that big a risk to start using what you have. But by the same token, you know, I\nsaw this video where this American asked some Japanese kids if they speak\nEnglish and they sort of answer in monosyllables and they sort of implies,\nwell, I guess you want to go to America. And they said, well, no, actually\nI'd rather go to Singapore. Do you ever want to live outside of Japan? Do you ever want to live\nin America or Europe or? I'm, uh, I want to go to. Um, Singapore. Like why is the assumption that people\nare learning English because they want to go and speak to Americans or English\npeople, not necessarily English is a major means of international communication. And so the motivation can be many. However, the fact that the Japanese\ndon't do so well in English is not so surprising because they live in\nJapan, 125 million Japanese people. They don't have any immediate\nneighbors who speak other languages. If you look at Canada with all the\nmoney that the Canadian federal government spends on language learning,\nyou know, they have a five year plan, like straight out of the Soviet\nunion action plan for languages, 4. 2 billion to increase the bilingual. So it's a very high level rate amongst\nEnglish Canadians, and yet it's continuing to drop every year, despite\nall of those expenditures, as you can see from this, this graph here. Amongst the English speaking population\nin Canada, fewer people speak French than Japanese people who speak English. So it all comes back to motivation\nand what you do to improve your language skills, and that's where\nI think reading a book comes in. Reading a book is powerful,\nbut you have to prepare for it. If I take the case of,\nof Chinese or German. Or other languages, I have gone through\na period of building up my vocabulary. Now that I use LingQ, I bring books in\nand I work up my vocabulary knowledge and I combine it with listening\nuntil I get to a level where I can actually listen to the book on its own. So it's something that I\nthink is very important to do. Anyone that, that has read one\nnovel can read a second novel and it doesn't have to be a novel. It can be a book on history, it can be\na book on gardening, but there's a great sense of satisfaction in doing that. And so therefore at LingQ we started this\nread a book challenge where members at LingQ are bringing books in or finding\nbooks in our library and they've sort of announced that to the challenge\nthat this is what their goal is. And it's, it's kind of a motivator. It's a way for people to\nmotivate each other at LingQ. And it's also a way to encourage people\nto do this relatively inexpensive thing, which is so powerful when\nit comes to language learning. One thing I would caution you, as you'll\nsee when I go through this, obviously not all digital books that you buy\nare available to import into LingQ. So we have some in our library. Some websites allow you to download\nthe, uh, you know, the electronic file, which can then be imported into LingQ. But some websites, these, uh,\ndigital files are DRM protected. You're going to have to\nfind your way around those. In the case of Turkish, the Storytel\napp only let me read on the app. So it's, it takes a little bit of\nwork to find places where you can get books, particularly modern books,\nclassical books is easier, uh, that you can then, uh, download the, uh, the\ndigital file and import it into LingQ. I wish more people would read books. It's an inexpensive thing to do. It gives you a great sense of achievement. It's a very clear objective. And of course, if you bring the books,\na digital version of the book that you are also going to read on paper, but\nif you bring that in, it has a number of advantages, not only that you can\nlook words up and you have all of the functionality at LingQ that help\nyou learn words and get used to the language and you can even listen to it,\nbut you now start getting statistics. So if an average book\nhas 80, 000 words in it. You bring in a book with 80, 000 words,\nyour statistics, once you finish the book, if you read it on LingQ, as well\nas reading it on paper, will reflect that you have now read those number of words. If you are looking words up as you\ngo, it'll indicate which words you know, which words you have learned. So there's a lot of advantage to,\nyou know, in addition to reading the book on paper, bring the\ndigital version into LingQ, do it as part of the LingQ book challenge. And I think it'll be a big boost. To your language progress in\nwhatever language you're learning. Thanks for listening."

        "title": "How to pick the right language book for self-study",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk a little bit\nabout textbooks, language textbooks. I consume a lot of textbooks. I buy them, I use them. They're a big part of\nmy language learning. Even though I spend most of my time on\nLingQ, I also love language textbooks. And I have things that I like\nand things that I dislike. And I want to talk about that sort\nof with reference to something called learner centered language instruction. Uh, because someone brought to my\nattention that this is a bit of a buzzword now within the language teaching industry. So I Googled, I found a graph showing\nsome of the key features of a learner centered, you know, language instruction. And I tried to relate this to\nmy own experience as a learner. I am a learner. So I am learner centered. Now, a teacher, of course,\nhas to deal with a classroom. And so for the teacher, the issue\nis how do you motivate the learner to be interested in learning? And the idea being, if you can make\nit more about the learner, then the learner is going to be more\nenthusiastic, more motivated to learn. Uh, they say make, uh, the class, I guess,\nrelevant to life outside the classroom. Language learning is all\nabout outside the classroom. Language learning is about acquiring\na skill that you will use Outside the classroom, if the only purpose\nfor learning the language is to interact with your teacher or interact\nwith other students or do tests, there's not much purpose to it. The purpose is entirely\noutside the classroom. And that brings me to someone\nlike me, the independent learner. So I don't go to classes,\nbut I do use textbooks. And so what do I consider to be the most\nimportant features of a good textbook? So I will show you some of the\ntextbooks that I have here, some of which go back over 50 years when\nI was learning Chinese and some of the things that I found particularly\nbeneficial in those textbooks. In summary, what I feel is this, the\naverage starter book, and I think that the Teach Yourself series,\ncomplete Turkish, complete, uh, you know, Romanian, whatever, that,\nthat is the best value for money. It's not as expensive as some, I searched\nat Amazon and I found, you know, a range of prices for say Turkish books,\nbut the Complete Series does the job because we have to understand what the\npurpose of a starter book, and I call them all Assimil, Living Language. These are all starter books. These are books that get you going. That's all they can achieve. Even though they promise you,\nyou know, B2 in the language, that's not going to happen. They can give you a\ntaste for the language. And I remember my starter books. And I remember the voice, you know,\nwhen I hear for the first time Czech or Romanian, uh, and I see some\ndialogues, I find that very stimulating. I enjoy them. And the starter book gets you started\nbecause there's essentially very little content in a starter book. If a starter book is 200\npages long, there might be. Max 7, 000 to 10, 000 words of\nactual language content there. An average book is, let's\nsay 60, 70, 000 words. There is no more than 10\npercent actual content there. Uh, there might be some sample sentences,\nbut there's a lot of drills, which I don't do, fill in the blanks, lots\nof explanations, all of these things that are not actual learning content. So the point is that if a starter\nbook, like Teach Yourself, has a couple of hours of audio and\nlet's say 7, 000 to 10, 000 words. If I look at my statistics at LingQ,\nI will listen, you know, 200, 500, 800 hours since I started on a given\nlanguage, say Arabic or Persian. And, uh, I will read 500, 000 words,\n900, 000 words in the case of Czech, 1. 5 million words. So you have to consume so much time. of the language to achieve any kind of\nlevel, certainly in order to achieve a level like B2, that the starter\nbook is just that, a starter book, and which is good, which is important. It's also a place you go back to. I keep my starter books. If I were to go back right now to\nrefresh my Romanian or my Greek, I would go back to my starter book. I would also go back to my mini stories\nto kind of propel me even further, but it is comforting to grab a book,\nlook at things that you have learned before, renew your acquaintance\nwith these content and so forth. All good. So that's the role of a starter book. I should also point out that when I was\nstudying Chinese, of course, I was not just dealing with starter books and I\nhad a number of textbooks, which I will show you in, in a video, which were\nvery effective because of one thing, and this is something that can apply to\nall textbooks, lots of emphasis on text. Patterns, patterns, and wherever they\ntried to explain in a complicated way, the structure of Chinese grammar, for\nexample, I didn't look at that at all. I couldn't figure out, they had symbols\nand letters and diagrams, didn't know what they were talking about. But when they say, here's a sample,\nhere's how people say, you know, uh, like even though,\nnevertheless, that's a pattern. And so five examples,\npatterns are important. And we don't get enough of that\nin standard language textbooks. We get lots of explanation. Lots of drills, lots of quizzes. We don't get enough examples. I once bought a book in Russian,\n53 models or examples of Russian. So just models, just examples, no tests,\nno quiz, limited explanation, examples. We learn from examples. We can relate to examples. We don't relate to\nexplanations quite as well. And I don't relate to being quizzed and\nasked questions that forced me to think. I just want to see how the language\nworks in many different examples. And I think that's where\nlanguage textbooks. could improve. Another area, which I think language\ntextbooks should do, which we did with our mini stories at LingQ,\ngive us more repetition within the same lesson and across different\nlessons of the same vocabulary. Trouble with going in, as we do in\ntraditional textbooks very often, to go from the post office to the train station,\nto the hospital, to this, to that, you're not getting enough repetition. The assumption is if you come across\nnew vocabulary in a lesson, now you're going to learn that vocabulary. Well, you won't. You have to see it again\nand again and again. One more thing with language textbooks\nthat I think is, is unfortunate is if I buy a language textbook,\nin my view, I should be entitled to the digital text and the audio. Typically that audio is there, used\nto be in the form of a CD that came with the book, and now increasingly\nyou can go and download the audio. Although, sometimes it's made difficult,\nand I have had, The experience, for example, most recently with my\nTurkish, uh, textbook from the, uh, Emre Yunus Institutu, where you go to\na website, they promise you the audio, the audio, the website doesn't exist. I phoned them when I was in Turkey\nand they say, well, use the QR code. The QR code doesn't work. I sent them an email\nand they never answered. So that's perhaps a bad\nexample, but I've had other. Situations where it was\ndifficult to get at the audio. Maybe too, it was the case that I\nbought a textbook a long while ago, and the audio used to be at a certain\nwebsite and it's no longer there. However, very important\nthat we have the audio. Normally, that is available. But by the same token, and while\nthere might be some concerns about it, Pirating in one thing and another. I want the digital text. I pay for the book. I'm willing to pay extra for the digital\ntext, but because a good textbook has a glossary for each chapter, not like\nASIMIL, which gives you the translation, which is less satisfactory because\nyou constantly have to look over and try and find the word that you didn't\nunderstand, a glossary is better. But even a glossary, some of the\nwords in the glossary, you will know. Not every word you don't\nknow is in the glossary. And by the way, the glossary should\nbe right up against the lesson you're doing, not at the back of the book\nsomewhere, because that's hopeless. You want to see the meaning of the\nword and review it right next to the text that you're reading, which is\nusually the case, but not always. But the digital text, particularly with\nme who uses LingQ all the time, means that I can bring the digital text into LingQ. I may not be able to match the\naudio to it, But at least I get the digital text and I can look\nup the words that I need to know. I can review them. I can look at it in sentence mode. I can do all the things\nthat I want to do at LingQ. But to do that, I need the digital\ntext, typically not available. So that to me is a big gap. I mean, we're living in a world now\nwhere content is available everywhere. Online dictionaries are\navailable everywhere. There are all kinds of tools\nthat we can use in a digital environment that help us learn. Yes, I like the book. I like the paper book. I like the traditional book. But I also want to, in addition,\nwant to have the digital. And as long as I pay for it, I should\nbe able to do that, in my opinion. Another peeve that I have, and\nparticularly with unfamiliar scripts, give us larger font. Most textbooks for learning Arabic\nand Persian have very small font. That makes it very difficult. As it is, I have trouble reading\nin those unfamiliar scripts because it's, you know, relatively new to me. As I say, I would prefer\nto have it available. In digital format so that I\ncan look the words up, but I still want to read it on paper. But if the font is so small,\nit's just too difficult. And I don't know why they don't,\nin these Arabic and Persian textbooks, don't give us larger font. And ideally, because the script is such\nan obstacle, at least for me, ideally with the translation right underneath,\nas well as a glossary for each chapter. And very often that's not provided. Now, I understand that very often\nif you're making an Arabic textbook, you don't know if the learner\nis a native speaker of English, Chinese, uh, Spanish, Russian. So what are you going to provide\nthe glossary in what language? That's why we need to have the\ndigital text so that learners can look up using dictionaries that\nconvert to their own language online. The best language textbook, or one of the\nbest, was this Reader in Modern Chinese. And it was just full of structures,\npatterns, one textbook had the, uh, texts, but lots of structure examples,\nwhich is what I always look for. And as you can see, I write all\nover these, all of the vocabularies introduced with examples. Once they get into notes and\ngrammatical explanations. I'm lost. S plus V, N plus whatever. I'm out of there. But when they show actual\nexample structures, uh, then I find that extremely useful. And I spent a lot of time on it. So this was a great book and a\nlot of time on that textbook. In a way, this, um, Korean\ntextbook from UBC, uh, continuing Korean has a lot of the same,\nlots of patterns in the language. With translation underneath, which is\nalso, in my opinion, very important. When you're looking at sample sentences,\nyou want to know what the words are. If you don't have access to digital text. Twenty Lectures on Chinese\nCulture was a sort of easy introduction to Chinese culture. Uh, again, a real favorite as I\nwas discovering Chinese culture. The whole range of textbooks\nthat were available for Chinese were tremendous, the Yale series. And as you can see, you know, selected\nreadings in Chinese communist literature. This one was, what was it now,\nContemporary Chinese Literature, contemporary meaning, you know,\nthe 1920s, but lots of notes, lots of poring over these and learning. Seminary over here. Contemporary Chinese literature too. Yeah. So, readers with glossaries. There's this modern Chinese. More of the same. Uh and here are the texts. Pretty serious looking texts\nas I discovered Chinese. So that was a good experience. I didn't have a Japanese textbook. I basically learned Japanese on my own. Um, a lot of listening and reading. I did a lot of reading in Hiragana, a\nseries called the Naganuma series, but I, I don't have those books anymore. I had to read a lot of Hiragana\nbecause I was not used to Hiragana. Another major effort of mine was in\nGerman, where I was able to find readers with vocabulary on the, along the margin. And so that was great. Lots of readers, you need readers\nhere, you know, another reader. Daveig zum lesen, lots of\nreading with vocabulary. And of course, typically\nI underline or highlight. So that was German, uh, again, the same\nwith Czech, but with the Czech, they were trying to provide translations\ninto German and English and the whole page became very busy and I didn't\nspend much time on this textbook. Persian textbook that I bought here. Again, you know, the font is so small. It's very difficult to read for me. And I find it difficult to read in\nPersian and Arabic for the time being, unless they really almost give you\na line by line translations or if a digital text is made available. And, uh, of course, none of\nthese people have digital texts. This is one of my main. Peaves that they make\nit difficult for you. I mentioned the importance\nof phrases and patterns. This was a great book because it\ndoesn't do a lot of explaining. It doesn't have a lot of exercises. In Russia, but it just has sample\nstructure, how the structure of the language works, and\nyou just see lots of examples. Uh, this is a great book for\nUkrainian beginner Ukrainian. Again. Uh, I found all that with Ukrainian,\nI graduated very quickly on to just listening to the language and reading\nit on link because the structure, the Slavic languages are kind of similar. And 60 percent of the vocabulary\nis similar to Russian. This is fun. You know, do Ukrainian from Polish\nor do learn Polish using Ukrainian. I'm sort of saving these cause\nI'm going back to Ukrainian. I have a lot of Arabic textbooks,\nbut they all have the same problem. They're not, there's no digital text. So it's very difficult for me. I was able to load some of these, uh,\nlingualism texts into LingQ and look up words and that helped, uh, you know, text\nlike this is an example, advanced media Arabic, so they'll have, uh, you know, uh,\nnews items, but they're immediately dated. They're from 2010 or something. I can get stuff online, bring it\ninto LingQ and learn the vocabulary. And I can be doing it every day with\nthings that are of interest to me. When I was in Poland,\nagain, I like history. So I bought this book, History of\nKrakow, which I read in Polish. And here's a history of Ukraine. If there are more history books with\nglossaries, with audio, with digital text, to me, that's at least in so far\nas, you know, my interests are concerned. You know, I mentioned Turkish. Here's a series put out by\nthe Yunus Emre Institutu. Generally, I, I buy a lot of Complete\nLiving, already called Teach Yourself. It's good value. I have bought a lot of Assimil. I think it's less good value because\nthe sort of content lesson ratio to size of the book is, is not very favorable. And of course they promise you that, uh,\nyou will reach B2, which of course you won't for reasons that I have explained. So, to summarize, a textbook is by\ndefinition learner centered, or should be. The assumption should be that the\nlearner is learning on his or her own. The learner may be helped in a\nclassroom, but it's his or her book. He or she takes it away. It becomes a favorite possession. That's how I look on these textbooks. And therefore, they are, in\nessence, learner centered. And the assumption, and I think in\nmany cases, like teach yourself, the, teach yourself, the assumption\nis you are not in a classroom. Uh, it seems, uh, that some of the\ntextbooks used in classrooms, which are no better, but much more expensive and\nare designed to be teacher centered. Like I showed the other day, an example of\na textbook in, uh, Stanford that was for Italian that was selling for two or 300. That's just ridiculous because\none textbook can only have. So much content there. It can only take you so far along the way. It can, it might be a beginner book. It might be a book at an intermediate\nlevel, but it can only provide you with so much of the language. You need much, much more. And, uh, if we are truly\nlearner, learner centered. Therefore, we are motivated, we\nare motivated to consume more and more of the language, and therefore\nwe're taking charge of our learning. And if we do those things, and if the\nlanguage textbook industry improves, recognizes where they fit in as an\nalternative to learning online, but an important and valuable alternative, and\none that should integrate with learning online, if all of that happens, then\nwe can all continue to learn languages on our own, which is what I do. Thank you for listening."

        "title": "5 ways to improve your pronunciation in any language",
        "transcript": "Hi there. Today, I want to talk about pronunciation. And the reason for that is that, uh,\nsomeone brought to my attention a study that showed that people who have better\npronunciation, they are judged more severely for their grammar errors than\npeople who have better pronunciation. You know, less native like pronunciation. It's as if the better you pronounce\nthe language, maybe the higher people's expectations are, or for whatever\nreason, it seems that you shouldn't get ahead of your level in the language\nby focusing too much on pronunciation before you are at sort of a level of,\nof comfort in using the language, which suits that level of pronunciation. So I want to talk a little bit\nmore about what I consider to be the goals when we look at. Pronunciation in a language we're\nlearning and some of the ways that we can improve our pronunciation\nin line with these goals. As usual, I did a fair amount of\nresearch on the internet and the subject of pronunciation and a word came\nalong that I was not aware of, hadn't heard before called suprasegmentals. And apparently in pronunciation,\npeople focus on the segmentals, which is the Specifics of how to\npronounce the guttural R or the U or other sounds that are sometimes\ndifficult in a particular language. Those are the segmentals. Those are the details. Whereas the supra segmentals is more\nthe sort of how the language comes across the intonation, the stress, the\ntiming, the feel that you can project. And it seems that the supra\nsegmentals are more important than the nuts and bolts of the language. And it's not surprising to me because. Pronunciation is part of the whole\nprocess of acquiring a language. As we have better usage, better control\nover the patterns and the phrases of the language, naturally our timing in\nthe language is going to be better, our intonation in the language is going\nto be better, and as a result, the pronunciation is going to be better. So you can't just isolate pronunciation. And to me, the goal in pronunciation,\nwhen I learn another language, my goal is that I want to be comfortable and I want\nthe person listening to me, typically the native speaker, to be comfortable. I don't expect of myself that I will\nbe perfect, but I would like to feel comfortable speaking the language. I don't want to feel as if I'm making\nclanging errors of pronunciation. And similarly, I want the person listening\nto me, especially the native speaker, to feel comfortable listening to me. That doesn't mean perfection\nand it doesn't mean a native like level in the language. If we look at the, the issue of\nsegmentals, this is the first point, the sort of specific sounds in a language\nthat are difficult, these can be vowels, these can be consonants, I happen\nto believe that the vowels are more important, you know, I think if you, if\nyou can't make a guttural R in French, it doesn't matter, if you can't roll\nyour R, Quite the way the Spanish do. I don't think it's so important. Uh, if you have an aspirated T or not\naspirated T, if you're a German speaking English and you simply can't nail the W\nsound, to me, that's not so important. On the other hand, if the\nvowel is U, it's got to be U. If it's U, it's got to be U. So, uh, some of these, um, sounds that are\nnot native to say to an English speaker. I think we have to make a\nspecial effort to learn them. And I remember when I was learning\nChinese, I worked rather specifically on the sound like, yeah, like, and\nI had to force myself because it was not something that I was used to. So I think in every language, there is a\nsmall number of sounds that we can make a special effort to get better at, but there\naren't very many of them in each language. In Swedish, for example, there's\nthis, I can't do it, but I'm quite comfortable in my Swedish. So we can work a little bit\non some of these without. Being too demanding. But overall though, we have to put\ngreater emphasis on the intonation, the suprasegmentals, and that\nmeans a major emphasis on a sort of holistic approach to the language. And so again, this means that improving\nyour pronunciation is going to be a matter of lots of listening and reading. Also, you know, pronunciation is\nconnected to reading because every time we're reading, we're sub vocalizing. So we have to have some sense of how\nthe language should be pronounced. So then this raises the question\nof how much explicit, uh, pronunciation instruction is useful. And there have been a number of\nstudies on this subject, and I'll leave links in the description box. But it is not at all clear that if\nyou have two groups of students, one group that is given a lot of listening\nto do without specific pronunciation instruction, and another group that's\ngiven specific pronunciation instruction, not obvious that those with specific\npronunciation instruction do better. Now, all of these things are so\nsubjective because there's always going to be some pronunciation instruction. There's going to be some attention to\nthe details of how words are pronounced. Those that were given specific\npronunciation instruction are also going to do a lot of listening. Motivation comes into it. So it's not black and white, but\nthe main point is that it's not obvious that specific pronunciation\ninstruction is tremendously important. Point number two, from my own personal\nexperience, and I think I pronounce quite well and I have the advantage that\nI have learned a number of languages. So to that extent, my brain is a little\nmore flexible when it comes to sounds. Obviously, if you only have one\nlanguage, you're kind of constrained. You're only used to those sounds. Those phonemes, the more languages\nyou learn, the more flexible you are, the better you hear different\nsounds in different languages, the better you can pronounce them. So I have an advantage there. However, my approach has always been\nlots of listening, lots of listening. And I like to combine listening\nwith reading if I can get access to the transcript of what I am\nListening to, and of course in an initial period I listen to the mini\nstories where I do have a transcript. But even if I'm listening to something\nthat I don't understand very well, I like to try to reach in there\nand identify phrases and words, pay attention to what I'm listening to. It's not just background noise. It's not turning on the Spanish radio\nwhile you're chatting with your friends. It's got to be a listening process\nwhere you're actually listening to the intonation of the language. You are bombarding your brain with\nthe sounds and the intonation and the cadence and the timing of the language. And I believe that has a\ntremendously beneficial effect. It doesn't mean that I'm going\nto pronounce the same way as you. What I hear, and, uh, I could\nbe listening to Portuguese from Portugal and Portuguese from Brazil. And so there's definitely\ngoing to be a mixture. For example, in Sweden, where people\nwatch television in the original language, most of the programs will be American\nEnglish, but some will be British English. And, uh, the Swedes, they're typically,\ntheir pronunciation is kind of a mixture of British English and, and American\nEnglish, uh, with, uh, the influence of, of Swedish and that's fine too. Most Swedes, when they speak\nEnglish, they're very comfortable to listen to, very easy to understand. Now, in an ideal scenario, of course,\nyou have access to the transcript of what you're listening to. And there is a very close relationship\nbetween developing good listening skills and reading comprehension. So, the kinds of things that I do\nin order to learn the language, in other words, lots of listening\nand reading, also is beneficial for developing good pronunciation. Now, point number three,\ndon't be too demanding. Again, there was a study that I'll leave\na reference to in the description box. According to this study, people tend to\ngive themselves credit for having better pronunciation than they actually have. Maybe that's the case. At least that was what came\nout of this particular study. But I think often people feel a little bit\nembarrassed by their own pronunciation. So I think there could be a bit of\nboth people who think they pronounce better than they do and other people\nwho are more inhibited because they feel they don't pronounce that well. I think there again, the solution,\nthe happy medium is to not expect perfection, but to try to feel comfortable\nin the way you speak the language. Try to focus in on natural word usage,\nnatural phraseology, natural cadence, natural intonation, and not worry\ntoo much about whether you're able to hit that French U or U or Spanish\nrolled R or guttural R or whatever it might be in the different languages. That you might be learning. Another hint is try to acquire some\nsort of natural introductory phrases. For example, I find myself in French. I'm always saying, enfin, even\nwhen I speak other languages, it gives me time to, to think. In Japanese, so desu ne, sore dewa ne. You know, there's all these little\nthings that make even your moments when you are hesitating seem more natural. And I think that gives you a\nbetter cadence in the language. It's also important. And Say, if you're a Japanese speaker\nwhere the verb comes at the end, you've got to make sure that you develop the\nhabit of starting off your sentence by saying, I think this and that, rather\nthan saying this, this, this, I think, because that's all part of developing\na natural cadence in the language. And that's again, an example of how\nthe usage patterns, if you can get a good sense of the usage patterns\nthrough massive listening and reading, the pronunciation is kind of going\nto look after itself, in my opinion. However, I think when we are listening. We do have to try to\nwant to pronounce better. We have to try to pay attention. You know, I mentioned the Spanish speaker. I knew who would, who would\nsay sword instead of sword. You know, my father who used to say\nshoulder instead of shoulder, uh, and they would never change because for\nsome reason in their mind, they would. The way a word was spelled in English\nshould dictate how the word is pronounced. Unfortunately in English,\nthat's not the case. There are languages where the\nspelling is very consistent. Turkish was that way, Spanish is\nthat way, but there are lots of languages where that's not the case. And we have to get used to noticing\nhow the word is pronounced. Noticing it, not with the intention\nof trying to remember it, but just that we're paying attention. We have to be paying attention. If we pay attention and if we want\nto pronounce better, then I think we have a good chance of doing so. Again, not with the aim of trying. Perfection. And this brings me to the final\npoint, which is a little bit fuzzy. The whole approach, my approach to\npronunciation is somewhat fuzzy because I think it's part of that overall\nprocess of acquiring the language. We don't necessarily need to deliberately\nfocus a lot of our time on pronunciation. If we do all the other things that we\nneed to do to acquire the language, we're bombarding our brain with the sounds and\nthe words and the phrases of the language. The pronunciation by and\nlarge is going to come. Um, however, psychologically, I've\nalways found it very important to try to project yourself outside of\nyour own sort of national identity, language identity into that of the\nlanguage you're trying to learn. So if I'm speaking Chinese or Japanese\nor French or Spanish or Russian, I try to imagine myself one of them. As long as I'm sort of inhibited or\nI'm reluctant to take a chance, I don't want to fall flat on my face because\nI tried to pretend I was a Frenchman and I Didn't quite pull it off. It doesn't matter. You have to have what I've called\nthis cultural weightlessness. You, you don't want to have that feeling\nthat you are this, in my case, English speaker, attempting to speak Turkish. I'm just a person and I'm\ntrying to fit in with the Turks. I'm trying to project myself as a Turk. And I think that sort of attitude is an\nimportant part of breaking free of the, the constraints of your native language. Constraints that will always be there. You will always reflect\nlanguages that you already know. Particularly your native language. You'll reflect the patterns of your\nnative language in your word usage, but you will also reflect the patterns of\nyour native language in terms of the sounds, the pronunciation, in terms of\nthe intonation, the stress, that's why, you know, English speakers tend to have\nmore, you know, stress in their French. Whereas the French tend\nto be more monotonous. You have to pay attention. To that, that French is spoken\nin a more monotonous way. You have to imagine yourself\na Frenchman, speak that way. And with that, the rest of\nthe pronunciation will come. So I hope that was useful. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "The best app for learning a language on your own",
        "transcript": "My next video has been edited, it's\nready to go, and I just had a thought that I wanted to share with you\nbefore we get into today's video, I want to share with you the tremendous\nenjoyment that I get from learning a new language, and I'm referring\nto my recent experience in Turkey. By getting to a level where I could\nunderstand so much in the language, where I could communicate with people\nin the language, gave me so much enjoyment and even a sense of power. And enjoyment. In the connections that I was able\nto make with people, but by the same token, I sensed that by speaking their\nlanguage, I also gave enjoyment to the people in this case of Turkey. Now it may be that with English,\nit's almost a given that people should speak our language. But I am always impressed when I hear a\nnon native speaker speak well in English. Even with mistakes or with an accent,\nI'm always impressed and appreciative. And I think the same is true. And perhaps even more so when we learn the\nlanguages of other places and countries whose language is not the sort of\ninternational language that English is. So I just want to throw that in there\nbefore we get into today's subject. I've been learning languages for\njust about my whole adult life, since I'm 79, that's like 60 years. I realized very early that\nthe key to language learning success is meaningful input. What Stephen Krashen refers\nto as a meaningful message. Some content item, some message,\nsomething that we are interested in. We have to be interested in order\nto learn language from that. It's not grammar drills, it's not grammar\nexplanations, it's meaningful input. If you look around my library here,\nall the books behind me, and I've got shelves elsewhere, you'll see a\nlot of books in foreign languages. And for the longest time, I wanted to\nread these books on subjects of interest, but I was held back because there were\njust too many words that I didn't know. And looking words up in a conventional\ndictionary is very time consuming, and we very quickly get lost. Forget whatever meaning\nwe find in the dictionary. So about 20 years ago, I was tossing ideas\naround with my son, Mark, who, when he was at Yale, when he wasn't playing hockey for\nthe Yale Bulldogs, he studied engineering. And so he had some ideas. Out of this came LingQ. For the last 20 years, I have been\nusing LingQ as my main language learning Platform and tool link recently was\nsurveyed by an independent organization based out of a university that compares\ndifferent language learning apps. And lo and behold, link came out on top. I'll leave a link to this\nstudy in the description box. But let me go over with you seven\nreasons why I think LingQ is an excellent place to learn languages. Number one, it's the amount of meaningful\ninput that we have in our libraries. Now, the definition of\nmeaningful input can vary. It can vary from person to person. Obviously, it can vary depending\non your stage in the language. I find that at an early stage in learning\na language, I have a high tolerance for content that is relatively uninteresting,\nas long as there is a lot of repetition of high frequency vocabulary. And so I have a high tolerance for our\nmini stories, which I find very effective because the same vocabulary in a slightly\ndifferent form or tense or person repeats. And then I always feast on my many\nstories when I start into a language. And I often go back to the many\nstories in order to refresh my knowledge of a language. However, comes a point because\nmeaningful input is so important. We have to go out and find\nother things, things that are intrinsically more interesting. And in that regard, in our\nlibrary, you can search by topic. You can search by level\nin order to find the key. content and each one of our language\nlibraries, and we have over 50 languages at LingQ are full of interesting content. So I normally find that at the\nbeginner level and certainly the lower intermediate level, I tend\nto stay in the LingQ libraries. However, the second reason why LingQ is\nso effective is that we are not limited by what's in the LingQ libraries. In fact, the potential\ncontent is limitless. You know, it used to be when\nI was learning Chinese, for example, 50, 55 years ago. Everything was books, printed\nbooks, and open reel tape recorder. Well, that's no longer the case. We live in a world where the internet\nis full of all kinds of content. E books, podcasts, YouTube videos,\nmovies on Netflix, you name it. Whatever is available on the\ninternet, Can be imported into LingQ as learning content. It can be imported as a file,\nas an ebook, as an mp3 file. It can be scanned into LingQ. Uh, I have even taken photographs of\ncontent in a foreign language, passed it through chat GPT to get the digital\nversion and I import that into LingQ. So there is no limit. To the kind of content you can use. This means that it's easier to be\ndealing with meaningful content. In the old model, the teacher\ntold you what to study, told you which textbooks to use. I'll show you a picture here of a book in\nthe Stanford University bookstore, 2015, several hundred dollars for the compulsory\ntextbook for the Italian course. And that's only one book. At LingQ, you have access\nto limitless content. And it's the monthly cost for access to\nall of this content within our libraries, or that you can bring in from anywhere\non the internet is dollars a month. So that's the second\npoint, limitless content. Now, point number three, I mentioned\nthat I had trouble reading the books in my library because there\nwere too many unknown words. How do you acquire words? We need words. In order to access meaningful content,\neven in terms of studying grammar books, where there are examples of different\ngrammar patterns, if you don't know the words, you can't make much sense of the\ngrammar examples that they're showing you. So LingQ is extremely efficient\nat helping you acquire words. Every time you see a word you\ndon't know, you look it up. It goes into your personal database. The next time that word shows up,\nit's changed color because you'll have forgotten that you ever saw the word. And so you're able to follow\nthe progression of your words and phrases as they gradually\nbecome better and better known. So the database that you create is\nkind of like an external hard drive where you park all of the words as\nyou come across them and gradually. They are brought back to your initially\npassive vocabulary when you're reading and eventually some of them into your active\nvocabulary as you start to use them. Bear in mind that at LingQ, the content\nsyncs across all devices and whatever words you are acquiring in whatever\nlesson in one, whatever device, it's all synced across the system. Now, point number four, we know that\nmeaningful input, comprehensible input is how we learn languages. That's the fundamental way we get\nused to a language, we acquire words. However, meaningful implies motivated. We have to be motivated. And very often we can be sort of\nworking with content which we might find intrinsically, Interesting, but\nwe feel that our progress is slow. We're continuing to forget\nthe same words and so forth. And that's where variety comes in. Variety of ways of\naccessing the same content. So you can read it. You can read it on page view. If the content is difficult, you\ncan read it in sentence view. The advantage here is that you\ncan actually have the live audio timestamp to match that sentence. You can look up individual words. There are even exercises where you. Reconstitute the sentence. So you can work very intensively\nsentence by sentence, or you can go through the content page by page. You can also read in what we call\nkaraoke mode, where you can listen to the audio and follow the words\nin the text, much like in karaoke. Also, we need to remember\nthat listening and reading are very similar in our brains. In other words, when we are reading,\nwhich is something that humans started doing relatively recently, Once we have\ndecoded the letters, the whole process of the sounds and the meaning making its\nway through your brain and connecting neurons is essentially the same. So reading and listening are very similar. In fact, studies show that listening has\nthe same impact on your brain as reading. And so LingQ, which gets you to listen and\nread to the same content, is strengthening your ability to do both those things. And in life, we need to be good readers. We need to be good listeners. So the variety of ways whereby you can\naccess this meaningful input at LingQ and the ease with which you can change\nto something else when you get tired of what you're listening to, all of this\nstrengthens our ability to listen and read and to learn not only languages,\nbut other things in life as well. Now, when we acquire these words\nor when we put these words into our database, Somewhere in our memory\nreserve in our brain or parked them in our external disk drive, we\noccasionally need to review them. And here again, one feature of\nLingQ is the variety of ways there are to review your vocabulary. You can review your vocabulary\nin a great long list if you want. You can review them in flashcards. My personal preference is to review\nmy vocabulary after each page, because it's then very close to\nwhere I saw them in a given context. I know from experience that\nreviewing vocabulary doesn't mean that it's going to stick. But the closer I do that to the\ncontent, the better off I am. But even there, we have a choice. We can review them in flashcards. We can review them as a list. We can review all the\nwords in a given lesson. We can review The words in a\nsentence or on a page, all of this variety keeps things fresh for us. It's very easy when learning languages\nto have the feeling that we're working very hard and we're not getting anywhere. That's why LingQ enables this\nvariety, this switching to different types of activities to keep\nthings fresh and the brain likes variety, the brain likes novelty. Now, some of you will say, well,\nwhat about speaking correctly, correct usage, grammar? How does LingQ deal with that? Well, of course we want\nto speak correctly. I firmly believe that the only way to\nget to speaking correctly is to expose yourself to enough meaningful content. But even there, it can be helpful\nto review grammar explanations. I find myself always\nbuying a grammar book. We even have grammar reviews at\nLingQ for many of our languages. And of course, I like to seek out the\nservices of an online tutor, where we have conversations, the tutor will often\npoint out my mistakes or structures that I have trouble with, send me a report\nwith some of these words and phrases. Of course, I know from my own\nexperience, because I import these tutor reports as content and link,\nand I go back three months later. Six months prior, and I see that I make\nthe same mistakes over and over again. Doesn't matter. Looking up a grammar rule\ndoesn't mean you're going to get it right the next time. Being correct. It doesn't mean you'll get\nit correct the next time. However, it's part of the process\nof making you more aware of what's happening in the language, but it has\nto happen based on a solid set of rules. Sense of the language. You, you have to have that experience\nand exposure to the language. And only then can you make sense\nof grammar explanations, have a hope of speaking correctly. And of course, eventually as you\ngain more and more confidence and a larger and larger vocabulary, you\nwant to speak more and more often. But the big thing at LingQ is that\nthe grammar activities, the, uh, tutor conversation activities are integrated\nwith your basic input based learning, with your accumulation of words and phrases. Point number seven on motivation. Obviously, if we go to a classroom,\nand again, I showed that picture of textbook at Stanford, if you attend\na language class at Stanford, I mean, you're paying tens of thousands\nof dollars to attend Stanford. I don't know what that works out to per\nlanguage course, but it's a lot of money. But, the language class Provides\nmotivation, provides a framework. You have to show up. You have the sense that you did something. So how do we deal with the need for people\nto have a sense of framework at LingQ? The way we deal with it is statistics. So you set yourself goals. I find the goals very motivating. When I find my enthusiasm flagging,\nI am nevertheless nudged by the desire to achieve my goals. For example, before going to Turkey,\nwhere I had a level of 8, 000 known words. In LingQ, I said in four months,\nI'm going to get to 35, 000 words. So even those days when I was not\nvery motivated to read my Turkish, I was nevertheless motivated to\nget to a couple of hundred or more new known words every day. So the statistics are very motivating. The statistics not only enable you to set\ngoals for yourself, but it also allows you to look back at what you have done\nor to compare yourself to other people who are involved in a language streak. All of these different ways create\na framework, create an environment that can be just as motivating\nas having to go to a classroom. And ultimately, The framework at\nLing has this advantage over the language classroom as a framework. And that is that it is portable. It goes with you wherever you are,\nand it makes you more independent. And to become an independent learner of\na language or really of anything fits in with the world in which we live. No longer is the classroom the\nonly, or even the main place where you acquire knowledge, whether\nit be language or other things. So learning to become an independent\nlearner at LingQ helps you when it comes to language learning, but also\nmakes you aware of all the other opportunities there are to work on your\neducation and learning on your own. Since we started LingQ,\nthe internet has evolved. The availability of language\ncontent has exploded. Technology is constantly\nevolving and so is LingQ. LingQ is so much more efficient\nnow than it was before. We are taking advantage of AI, for\nexample, to ensure that our word translations are context relevant,\nrather than simply giving you four or five words from a dictionary. AI enables us to transcribe MP3 files\nin order that these audio LingQ. And we are going to continue\nevolving as the technology evolves. So I just thought I would explain\nwhy I'm such a fan of LingQ. Obviously I'm involved, uh, my\nson Mark and I are co founders. And so it can easily be said that I'm\nnot being objective, but nevertheless, I just thought I would try to summarize my\nviews on what I think makes LingQ such an outstanding language learning platform. And of course we were recognized\nby that independent third party organization as being. The top of the pack when it\ncomes to language learning apps. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "How much Turkish did I learn in 7 months? Traveling to Turkey",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about language\nand travel with specific reference to my recent trip to Turkey, the preparation\nthat I made before going there, how I did, and I'm going to show you some pictures\nand some videos of my visit to Turkey. So language learning is about exploring. Travel is about exploring. It's about discovering new places. Just as learning languages is\nabout discovering new cultures, new languages, and new people. And so the two are often connected. And, uh, I have had the experience\nthat my plan to visit a country has been a major motivator in\ngetting me to learn the language, or at least to study the language. I've often felt that if you don't prepare\nproperly, if you just go to a country in the hope that somehow you'll pick up\nthe language, That's not so successful. I was not successful when I was in Vietnam\nbecause I did too little preparation. And even for Croatian, which was, you\nknow, a Slavic language, which I already had, I had some Slavic languages. I didn't do enough preparation. I wasn't able to use it at all. Or very, very little. So let's get back to Turkish. I mentioned before that back in 2019\nI said I know too little about, call it the Middle East, call it Central\nAsia, call it that part of the world, of which sort of Constantinople, or\nIstanbul rather, has historically been a hub, a center, connecting the Arab\nworld, the Greek world, The Turkish world, the Persian world, and a whole\nlot more, as I discovered on my visit. So, I started with Arabic, and then\nPersian, and then Turkish, but then I decided that because Persian and Arabic\nwere so much more difficult because of the writing system, I dropped Turkish, and I\nfocused on Arabic and Persian for the last five years, and with, I would say, limited\nsuccess, although a great deal of success. Enjoyment. So back in June, my wife and I\ndecided we're going to visit Turkey. I said, I'm going to crank up my Turkish. So you can see from my\nstatistics that I spent three months on Turkish back in 2019. And then I did essentially nothing. And starting in June, I picked it up. So I did four months of relatively\nintense, Turkish learning. One, two, three hours a day, some days. Lots of listening and reading. I will tell you exactly what I did,\nand then I will tell you the results. When I picked up my Turkish again, the\nfirst thing I did was to go back to my mini stories, which had been a major\npart of my learning back five years ago, to try and get back in the language. And the mini stories are always there,\nas I always call it, like my gym. You know, no matter how long it's been\nsince I last used the language, I can go there, And have a workout and somehow\nget back to where I was in the language. So I did that again, starting in June. I went back to the mini\nstories, kind of refreshed, got myself to where I was before. I had a level of about 8,\n000 words at that time. I said, I want to get to\n35, 000 words in Turkish. That's my goal in order to be able to\nhave any success when I'm in Turkey. Bear in mind that there are so many\ndifferent forms of, especially verbs in Turkish that this very high number. Doesn't mean that I have\nthis enormous vocabulary in Turkish, but it is an indicator. It is a bit of a milestone. I said, that's my goal. I want to get to 35, 000 words,\nthe way we count them, at length. So, in an initial period, once I\nleft the many stories, I found some sort of lower intermediate material. In our library at LingQ, and there\nis lots, and I would advise you in any language at LingQ, use the search\nfeature in the library, and you will discover lots of interesting material. And I was able to do that, and\nthat got me up to a certain point. However, When we're learning a\nlanguage, it's fun to find new, fresh, interesting material that we choose. And that's where I eventually\ngot motivated to find myself some audiobooks and ebooks. I discovered a website called Storytel,\nwhich apparently is based in Sweden. And they focus on a number of languages\nand they provide You'll see when I was in Bodrum in Turkey, there was\neven a taxi advertising Storytel. And so they have quite a\nlarge library in Turkish. I don't know the scope of their\nlibrary in other languages, but I focused in on history. I typed in, you know, tarih in\nTurkish to see what there was. I discovered a very prolific Turkish\nhistorian called Hilber Ortayl\u0131, who has written so many books on so many different\nsubjects, on Istanbul, on traveling around Turkey, on the relationship\nbetween Europe and Turkey, lots of stuff. I have no idea how authoritative\nhe is, I know he's quite popular, but it's real Turkish material\nand a subject of interest to me. And what I did there was, you can only\nlisten to The audio book in the app and for the text, the ebook, I would,\nuh, capture a screenshot in my iPad. And I found the best way then to get that\ninto Link as a lesson was to go to ChatGPT and ask ChatGPT to convert that JPEG into\ntext, which comes out fairly quickly. And then I have something\nthat I can work on in Link. So I spent a lot of time doing that. Learning a lot about Turkish history. I eventually bought the books that I\nwas using on, you know, storytelling. Because I like to hold paper books. But reading the paper\nbooks remained difficult. And in another video, I will talk about\nthis whole issue of how to connect real books with audio, with digital text. And in fact, I'll be looking for\ninput from people on what the best ways are to do all of this. Now, if I'm going to go to Turkey,\nI'm going to want to speak. That means I have to prepare for speaking. So, in the past, where I was somewhat\nsuccessful, or quite successful, in Czech, in Romanian, in Greek, I made sure that\nI had a lot of online tutor sessions. before going. So here we have two excellent\ntutors at LingQ, Baha and Tunjay. And I had two sessions\nwith each of them per week. So a total of four sessions\nfor the last period. Again, you'll see that in\nmy statistics at LingQ. I was up to 10 or 11 hours a week of\nspeaking, which does a number of things. It, it triggers curiosity, it triggers\nawareness, it helps you search for words. But at the same time, I continued\nmy intensive input activities. So now, how did it go in Turkey? Well, first of all, Turkey\nis a fascinating country. It's at the crossroads. And you become aware when you visit, uh,\nIstanbul, which was once Constantinople, which was once the second Rome, the\ncapital of the Roman Empire for 300 years, which then became the capital of\nwhat the citizens continued to call Rome, citizens of the Byzantine Empire, but\nwhich was subsequently, I think in the 18th century or the 19th century, called\nthe Byzantine Empire, but which to the people who lived there was still Rome. Rome, which spoke Greek, which spoke\nAramaic, which spoke different languages. Soon after arriving, we went to this\nmuseum on Hagia Sophia, Hagia Sophia, which described this evolution in\nTurkey from pre Christian to Christian to, you know, the Byzantine Empire. riots, whatever. And then the, uh, Crusaders who\ncame and destroyed Hagia Sophia or destroyed much of Constantinople\nbecause they were more interested in looting than in saving Jerusalem. And then eventually when Constantinople\nwas conquered by the Turks, the Ottoman Empire, the name wasn't\nto change immediately to Istanbul. It was Constantinia or something\nfor a long time, and eventually it became Constantinople. Istanbul somewhat later. Things that I learned from my reading\nof books written by Ilbert Ortalya. So it was fascinating. You're there, and we stayed at a hotel\nwhere we overlooked the Blue Mosque, this magnificent structure built by\nSultan Ahmet, and we were in an area of Istanbul where there are a lot of mosques. These historical monuments, column\nbuildings, structures, like, well, first of all, you're right on the Hippodrome,\nwhich was the center of the city, and you're looking at the Sultan Ahmed\nMosque, Topkapi Palace, and so forth. So, it's a great area to be in. You're right by the water because\nthere you are on the European side, across the water is the Asian side. Quite an arbitrary division. It's the city, it's one city. And down by the water, you see this\ntremendous activity of boats that are either crisscrossing, The Bosphorus\nor we went on a tour for 150 lira. You get a tour of the Bosphorus and see\nwonderful structures, other palaces, uh, residential homes and so forth and so on. Fascinating, just color and shops\nselling every manner of, you know, spices and, uh, colorful, you know, clothing. And everything about Turkey is\ncolorful and, and an abundance of things that are available for sale. It's a, It's a feast for the eyes. But while in Turkey, and I'll explain, we\nwere in Istanbul, we went to Cappadocia, we were in Bodrum, which is in the south,\nor at least the west on the, the Aegean. So I suddenly discovered that I\ncouldn't, when traveling with my wife or participating in these tours, I\ncan't just plug my ears with my ears. Airpods and listen to Turkish, nor do\nI have a lot of opportunity to speak, to have some, and I'll get into that. So in a way, it can be said that my\nTurkish declined, or at least I was using my Turkish paradoxically in a way less\nwhile there than when I was in Vancouver, where I could easily spend two hours\na day listening to Turkish, where four hours a week I would speak Turkish. However, whenever I was able to use the\nTurkish, Whenever I spoke to someone in Turkish, the reaction was so positive. It was a delightful feeling to generate\nsort of an interest in you and a sense of friendliness simply because you spoke\ntheir language and they were curious as to why would you want to learn this\nlanguage and how do you go about doing it and a lot of sort of goodwill generated\nby the mere fact that I spoke Turkish. So that was the positive,\neven though I can't say that I improved my Turkish tremendously. However, I can say that the\neffort that I put in preparing, it got me to a level where. You know, I felt I could get myself out\nof trouble if I got into trouble, I felt comfortable, I could read everything\naround me, I could kind of get my meaning across in a limited sense, but not have\nan intellectual discussion on something. And yet at the same time, because my\npronunciation is quite good, I could easily get into trouble because I could\nsay something and then the person would come back in rapid fire Turkish and I\nwouldn't understand what they were saying. I will give you a sampling of my Turkish\nbefore leaving, parts of an interview that I had with my tutor, Tutor Baha. Central Asia is such an important region in world history. I understand. Like\u2026 three thousand years ago, there was an important early civilization in that area, with cities. Central Asia is, you know, central. From India, from Greece, from China, from Arabic, from Iran\u2026 there\u2019s influence from everywhere. Yes, in the middle of everything. In the middle of everything. Unfortunately, in Canada, at school,  they learn that Europe or North America is the center of the world. In Turkey\u2026 they learn that Turkey and the world are in the middle. But everywhere is the centre. That's why we need to know them. So who are the Turks? Turkish history. Did you learn Turkish history at school? Not at school. There is nothing about Turkish history. But in European history,  the Ottoman Army was in Vienna. There was a war with Poland,  Jan Sobieski. The furthest point reached by the Ottoman army. And also, a conversation that I\nhad with the hotel manager at this wonderful hotel, Haci Bayram, highly\nrecommended, a wonderful Turkish breakfast right there overlooking the sea. The, uh, Blue Mosque. And so you get a sense that I am able\nto communicate to some extent, but there was no dramatic improvement in my Turkish\nspeaking ability or comprehension. This hotel, Hac\u0131 Bayram, Sultan Ahmet, in Istanbul is  very good, very beautiful. The service is very good. Everything is comfortable. Sultan Ahmet is close by, there are restaurants everywhere. People are very, very friendly. the tram goes to Taksim, there\u2019s everything.  Everything. The people are very, uh, very friendly. Thank you very much, Steve. From two thousand years ago until now, there have been many people, many empires. In Istanbul.\nA central area, that is, Sultan Ahmet. However, I felt that I was amply\nrewarded for the effort that I put in declaring Turkish. One interesting aside, on four\ndifferent occasions, I met people who follow LingoSteve. The first time was at a restaurant,\na hotel restaurant, where the busboy follows me, and he said,\nAre you, you know, LingoSteve? And I was so excited, and he took a\npicture, and unfortunately, I forgot. To take a picture of him at the same time. However, there were three\nother similar occasions. One with an American, and\nyou'll see the picture of him. One with a Japanese follower of Negosteep. And one with a follower from\nHong Kong who was with a group of other people, again in Cappadocia,\nand we took a picture together. So that was kind of fun. So, getting back to then\nmy adventure in Turkey. I was rewarded, but I didn't\nfeel that I was able to improve. I was also rewarded because I was able\nto, while being in Turkey, discover so much about that fascinating country. First of all, obviously in Istanbul,\nwhere you have such a mixture of peoples. The famous Galata Tower in Istanbul was\nbuilt by the Genoese, people from Genoa. Crusaders were there, there's Armenians,\nGreeks, it's not to mention, of course, the predominant Turkish population\nthere with all the history that's there. But then we flew to Cappadocia, which On\nthe one hand, we went up in the blues. We saw these, uh, fairy like\nstructures where, uh, you know, people live, sort of in caves. But more than that, we\ntook a tour in that area. Several hours of driving around that area. And we realized, I realized, that I was in\nan area that I had read about in history. I had read about Alexander the\nGreat, or Alexander the Great Macedonian, who cut the Gordian Knot. That took place not far away. I have read about Lydia. I've read about Giza. The Midas touch, the king of Phrygia\nand those people on the Hittites, the Lydians, the Phrygians, these are\nAnatolian people who lived in Anatolia before the, uh, uh, Turks arrived. And of course, on the Western\nedge of Anatolia, there would be pushing with the Greeks who were\nsettling on the Western shores. And, uh, presumably those Anatolian\npeople were resisting them. And the interesting thing is, The\nextent to which all of these cultures mix, well, I'll stay with Cappadocia. We visited these underground cities where\nas many as 20, 000 people apparently lived underground whenever they were invaded by\nan army of Persians or Mongols or Arabs. And so you, we were on the crossroads\nof the movement of people and armies going back thousands of years. And this was driven home to me when\nafter Cappadocia, uh, my wife and I went to Bodrum on the Aegean,\nwhich is a lovely resort, mostly. Turkish people. It's like a Turkish Riviera, uh, lots of\nshops, uh, lots of seafood restaurants. And it was the Greek\ncity of Halicarnassus. A number of Greek\nphilosophers lived there. And there's two sort of major,\nuh, architectural remains there. One is the mausoleum, which\nwas considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. But it was a mausoleum to A\nAnatolian king who subsequently became a, a Persian satrap. So it was not a mausoleum to a Greek,\nbut it was designed and built by Greeks. Because there was a lot of cultural\ninteraction between the Greeks and these Anatolian people. Similarly, apparently, the amphitheater\nin Bodrum, at that time, if I'm not mistaken, going by memory, the\nking of that area was this satrap. So, again, it's a mixture of Greek\nculture, Greek architecture, local small nation states, call them,\nwho were under the sway of the Persian empire at different times. So, you have this feeling that you're\nin this place that has so much history. And, uh, You know, I, I\njust felt, I love history. It was wonderful to be in those places. And yet at the same time, it\nwas wonderful to be in Turkey. We went to Turkish Dolmus,\nwhich is sort of a form of, you know, public transportation,\nbut somewhat uncomfortable. But we did all of that and, you know, all\ntold it was just a wonderful experience. So the thought I want to leave you with. Perhaps there's a few here. Number one, if you are going to go\nto a country where the language you are learning is spoken, there's a\nvery worthwhile reason for learning a language, it's very motivating,\nbut prepare six months ahead. That's number one. It'll take you six\nmonths to get to a level. where you can benefit. Second of all, I found it difficult\nto use the language a lot. So to that extent, maybe, you\nknow, there was no dramatic uptick in my capability in Turkish. That's somewhat different from my\nexperience, for example, with Czech or even with Romanian, because those\nlanguages are easier or more similar to languages that I already know. With Turkish, it's a, it's\nmore of an uphill battle. struggle. And so I didn't see any major improvement. However, so in the short run,\nmaybe I even declined somewhat. But in the long run, to gain this\noverall sense of the Turkish language, the Turkish history, Turkish culture,\nhaving experienced the sights, the sounds, the tastes of Turkey, with a\nvery positive impression of the country, by the way, of the energy of the Turks. So if there are concentric circles\nin language learning, the nuts and bolts is the innermost circle. You keep on going back there. To try and drive into your brain\nthe sort of endings and grammatical fine points of the language. And yet, you're never confident that\nyou're doing that much whenever you're sort of revisiting these grammar points. But, if you do that within the context\nof lots of input, lots of listening and reading, lots of talking to people,\nand then you come across these, these, uh, nuts and bolts of the language in\ndifferent contexts, in a variety of contexts, gradually they start to sink in. So that's the second concentric language. Circle, but going to the country provided\nme with a third concentric circle. And that is this overall sort of sense\nof the environment of the language, the cultural context of a language, the real\nliving, breathing context of a language. And that gives me a level of motivation,\na level of understanding, which I feel is going to keep me going with\nthe language, which is going to, in a way that I can't explain, except\nthat I sense that this is the case. It makes it easier for me\nto understand the language. It makes it likely that\nI'll learn the language. faster than if I had\never gone to a country. So that's what I take away\nfrom my visit to Turkey. Again, I say, please\nprepare ahead of time. And if it's a language that's quite\ndifferent from one that you already know, you may not see any dramatic\nimprovement, but you'll come away with a sense of the language that\nis going to keep you on track to eventually achieve your language goals. Thank you for listening."

        "title": "10 tips for managing your time as a language learner",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about time\nmanagement and language learning. You've heard me say before that the\nthree keys to success in language learning are time, the amount of\ntime we spend with the language. Therefore, time management\nbecomes quite important. Our attitude towards the task and towards\nthe language and motivation in general. And third of all, that ability to\nnotice what's happening in the language. Which I will describe in another\nvideo and which is very much related to our attitude and how much\ntime we spend with the language. But let's just deal with this time issue. To me, the first thing when it comes to\ntime management is to avoid distraction. And that means to know why you are\nlearning the language, to be convinced that this is an important thing for you\nto do so that you stay in the moment. You don't begrudge the time that\nyou spend on the language, listening to the language, reading the\nlanguage, speaking the language. Even though you may not realize, or you\nmay not feel as if you're improving, you have to stay within the moment. You have to think this is\nwhere I want to be now. I don't want to be somewhere else so\nI can avoid all those distractions because I'm totally into what I'm doing. So that motivation, that sense of wanting\nto be in that language learning moment is a big part of successful learning. Time management when it\ncomes to language learning. Second of all, set a schedule. There are different activities,\nand in my case, I have different schedules for different activities. So, when I wake up in\nthe morning, I listen. I listen while getting the dishes out\nfor breakfast, while preparing breakfast, and I also clean up after breakfast,\nand I listen while I do these things. things. If I'm ever in the car, I listen. So that's my listening schedule. Very often I work out in the evening\nand do my kettlebell routine watching Heather Robertson or Juice and Toya. But while doing that, I listen, I\nhave a special set of headphones that, or at least I hook them up\nto my ear so they don't fall out. Those are my schedules for\nlistening, but I have a schedule for. Working on my iPad, doing the lesson. I do that typically around five\no'clock in the evening, five or six in the evening, sometimes after dinner. So that's my schedule for my\niPad linking type activities. But I also read a little\nbit before going to bed. Typically I'll have beside my bed, both\nsay a book that I'm reading in English, which is more pleasurable in a way. But I'll also have a book in\nthe target language by my bed. So that's another time set aside for\nmy specific language learning tasks. Stay on task, use goals, use the\nvarious prods, the statistics that we've built into LingQ, like a streak. If you signed up for a streak,\nyou have to maintain your streak. You have to do something every day. You have to maintain a\ncertain activity level. I have set a goal, for example, because\nsay the longer term goal is that my wife and I are visiting Turkey. So I said when I was\nat about 8, 000 words. From five years ago when I did Turkish,\nI said, I want to move that up to 35, 000 known words between June and September,\nthe end of September, which I have done. I'm now at 35, 000 known words. It's a specific goal. It helps me stay on task, which\nis a big part of time management. Another thing, do the important things\nfirst, prioritize your activities. So since my goal was to achieve 35,\n000 known words in Turkish, every day, the first thing I did was to\nknock in 200 or so new known words, the remaining additional known\nwords would come from my, you know, listening and reading activities,\nparticularly my reading activities. But in order to get that 200 a\nday, you know, well on my way to achieving that, I would go to. Typically, you know, five minute long\nlessons and in our, uh, lesson page on the iPad, a little right hand corner,\nI can go through my vocabulary list. I'll go through there looking at\neither new words or links that I've previously saved and move as\nmany of them as I can to known. Admittedly, easier to do in Turkish than\nperhaps in some other languages because there are so many forms of the same word,\nespecially verbs, but that was my goal. So I get rid of that\ntask first, every day. Next tip is with regard to\nspeaking, speaking is important. I'll stress the importance of input to\nget a certain vocabulary going, but then you have to have regular interactions\nwhere you can speak, uh, you might have a regular meetup wherever you live,\nwhere you can practice your language. Or you have online tutoring sessions. Typically with my online tutor, my link\ntutor, I will buy five or 10 lessons and I will schedule them Tuesday and Friday\nwith the one tutor, Wednesday and Friday with the other tutor, it's scheduled. It's always the same date. I know when I have them. Scheduling your speaking or output\nopportunities, I think is also important. I think to manage time, we\nhave to keep track of our time. At LingQ, we track your time per se,\nand we track your activity level. You can look at the last seven days, you\ncan look at the last three months, you can see how much time in total you're\nspending, because your words read, your LingQs saved, your hours of listening,\nthese are all indications of Time that you have spent on the task, time that you\nhave spent with the language, and you will see how much in total you've spent and\nhow much it fluctuates from day to day. I think it's important. If we're going to manage our time, we\nhave to be able to measure our time. And a lot of statistics at LingQ\nhelp you measure your time. The next tip is have a favorite\nplace for your favorite language learning activities. To me, the kitchen is a\nbig part of my listening. My kitchen and my car is\nwhere I do a lot of listening. That's the place for listening. Uh, I have a favorite chair that I\nsit in when I'm working on my iPad and that's where I do most of my listening. The vast majority of my iPad are my\nlinking, working with texts to save words and phrases or to review them. Beside my bed is my favorite place\nfor reading paper material, but I don't use the iPad by the bed. So, in other words, having a favorite\nplace for a specific activity, I think, helps to create a habit. That will help you manage your time and\nmake sure that you do those activities. Multitasking. There is a time for multitasking\nand a time for not to multitask. The form of language learning\nthat lends itself to multitasking, in my view, is listening. Described it now already how I\ndo listen while doing the dishes, exercising, driving my car. That's a great activity for multitasking. And I may decide that if I'm say\nexercising, which requires a little more concentration, I will listen to\neasier content like the mini stories. Whereas if, you know, doing the\ndishes doesn't require much attention and there I'll listen to more. Interesting or more difficult content,\nbut it is a form of multitasking. However, there are times when\nyou don't want to multitask. You obviously can't be\nreading and driving. If I'm working with my text and\nlooking up words and phrases, then I'm not multitasking. And so it's very important that I\navoid distractions, that I avoid. Going off to my iPhone or having the\ntelevision on in the background or any of that kind of stuff cannot be\ncombined with reading and looking up words and reviewing words. So there's a time for\nmultitasking and a time for focus. Now, I've already said that a key to\ntime management is to And that is that ability to focus, that ability to stay\nin the moment, the feeling that you want to be doing this, you want to be learning\nthe language, you recognize that you're improving with every minute that you\nspend with the language, even though you don't sense that you're improving. But the converse to that is there are\ntimes when you simply don't want to do it. And there you have to be able to let go. If you're not in the mood, if\nyou don't want to do it, you might be fresher tomorrow. You might be keener tomorrow. Don't force yourself when\nyou're not in the mood. Do something else, watch a video\nin the language, maybe, or do something totally different. Go for a run. Anything that takes you away from\nthe task that enables you to recharge your batteries is going to help you\ncome back and focus, and is going to help you manage your time effectively. Because, again, to summarize, if we want\nto be successful as language learners, we have to spend time with the language. We have to spend that time effectively,\nproductively, with a positive attitude. And if we do those things So I hope that\nthat little bit of my personal perspective on time management and language learning\ncan be a useful reference for some of you. I look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you."

        "title": "How to learn any Romance language",
        "transcript": "Today I want to talk about the Romance\nLanguages and in a way, the Romance of languages and learning languages. You are no doubt aware that\nlanguages are grouped into families. There are large sort of families\nof families, like the Indo- European family of languages. If you look at a map of the world, you\ncan see that certain languages have occupied large areas of the world. Other languages are very much sort\nof concentrated in smaller places. Typically, this is the result of the\nmovement of people, conquests, trade, whereby languages expand or influence the\nlanguages of neighboring peoples, whether it be European colonialist empires, but\nthe same has happened with, uh, I dunno, Bantu languages in Africa, Quechua as\nthe Incas expanded their empire, Turkish, which began somewhere in central Asia,\nmaybe on the borders of China, and now is spoken across a great swath of. Of Asia or Eurasia, but the greatest\nnumber of speakers are in Turkey, which wasn't the case a thousand years ago. In other words, these\nthings kind of move around. So the Romance languages are the\nlanguages that are somehow related to Rome and Latin was one of. of a variety of Italic languages\nspoken in what is today, Italy, when the Roman empire developed and\nexpanded, but the Roman Empire itself expanded those Italic languages at the\nexpense of Celtic languages or Latin. Other languages, presumably even\nlanguages related to Basque. Greek was spoken in Spain, for\nexample, prior to the Roman expansion. So there's constantly this ebb\nand flow and flux of languages. So the romance languages are the group\nof languages that are related to Latin. Typically the Experts say vulgar\nLatin, which was the common variety of Latin that was spoken in Europe. And we can see in this map that there\nis a great variety of Romance languages. We have the larger groupings like\nItalian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, but there are subsections\nwithin that in each of those countries. Sometimes these are called dialects. Sometimes these have declined and are\nnot spoken as widely as they once were. And some of them are languages that\nare hanging on to an independent. Existence, for example, Catalan,\nwhich is a very strong right now, Gallego in, in Spain, but in Italy, in\nFrance, there are regional variants. Most people today study the\ndominant Romance languages that are identified with the major\ncountries that speak those languages. So Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese,\nand those languages are spoken not only in Europe, but again, as a result\nof colonial expansion and so forth. Uh, spoken on other continents in the\nworld, as you can see from the map. So how different are these languages? These languages share a\nlot of common features. The vocabulary can be as close as\n89, 90 percent similar, which is the case between Spanish and Portuguese. Or it can be, you know, uh, as in\nthe case of say Spanish and English. And French, only 75 percent similar. French, in fact, in terms of vocabulary\nand even in terms of structure is closer to Italian than it is to the other Romance\nlanguages and Spanish and Portuguese. Are closer, not surprisingly to each\nother in vocabulary, but also in structure than they are to Italian,\neven though to our ears, Italian sounds more similar to Spanish. In fact, in terms of grammatical\nstructure, French and Italian are closer. In terms of vocabulary and my\nexperience also in terms of syntax or structure grammar. These languages are very\nsimilar to each other. However, there are significant\ndifferences in terms of grammar, in terms of Vocabulary Even in terms of\nsuch things as gender, where the same word might be feminine in one language\nand masculine in the other language, but there are also differences within\nthese languages, even within, without talking about regional variance, as\nin say Catalan, which is a, a, a, a regional, uh, Romance language, but even\nwithin Spanish, there are differences in pronunciation, differences in usage\nbetween Spain, let's say, and different countries in Latin America, similarly,\nmajor difference between Portuguese spoken in Portugal and Portuguese\nspoken in Brazil or in Mozambique and in French, again, uh, minor differences\nbetween Belgium, Switzerland, and France, more significant differences between\nthose European countries and Quebec. So typically. When you are going about learning one\nof these Romance languages, you will probably want to learn the version of\nthe language that is most convenient, most useful for you in your situation. So if you're going to be living in Brazil,\nor if you're going to be living in Quebec, then that's the variety that you probably\nwill want to learn, unless you have a strong preference for some other variety. Because typically, it's People\nunderstand each other across these different varieties. Despite what you may hear, I found\nthat Portuguese people have no trouble understanding Brazilians, vice versa. The same is true between Quebec\nand France, or different areas of the Spanish speaking world,\nunless the speakers really go into. Heavy slang, heavy regional sort of\nlanguage, very specific to their area, but they all can speak a sort of a\nneutral, easily understood form of the language, regardless of where they live. Very often learners of these\nlanguages make a big deal. About whether this particular bit\nof content, let's say at LingQ is, uh, European Spanish or Mexican\nSpanish or Argentinian Spanish. It's been my experience that at an\nearly stage in our learning, we can hardly even hear the difference. Uh, it's largely the same words. It's largely the same usage\npattern within those languages. Again, unless you get into very\ncasual slang type, uh, situations. So I found in learning these languages\nthat I would mix Portuguese with Brazilian, Portuguese, or different\nforms of Spanish, Mexican, Iberian. It didn't really matter. So then let's move on to this question\nof, you know, how do we go about learning these languages, these Romance languages? So I will sort of use my own\nexperience as, as an example. So I think the first thing,\nif we want to be successful in learning one or more of the Romance\nlanguages, we have to get motivated. There has to be something\nthat triggers us, a passion. In my own case, I was\nuninterested in French at school. I had a professor who\nvery much motivated me. We had a course on French civilization,\nuh, you know, writers, uh, you know, Racine, uh, Moli\u00e8re, you know,\nBalzac, all that kind of stuff. For whatever reason, it caught my fancy. Similarly, you know, they had\nthe movies of the Nouvelle Vague. Uh, of cinema in, uh, in the sort of late\nsixties, all of that got me motivated. So whether it be Italian, French,\nSpanish, Portuguese, you have to find something that motivates\nyou, that, that turns your crank. You want to learn for that reason. The motivation could also be a person. In fact, very often it is. So get that motivation. That's going to keep you going. The second thing is I would\nsay, focus on vocabulary. You need words, lots of words, do a\nlot of listening, do a lot of reading. There are grammatical features in\nthese Romance languages that can be troublesome for people who are\nnot used to Romance languages. First of all, gender of nouns, which\nhas nothing to do with, you know, when we identify gender with people, it's\njust that for whatever reason, Usage reason, grammatical reason, certain\nnouns have been designated as masculine and certain as feminine, and you just\nhave to learn because it matters. All of these languages have agreement\nof adjectives, so if the noun is masculine, then the corresponding\nadjective has to be in the masculine form. And similarly with feminine. So gender is a significant element. Sort of obstacle for many people because\nthere's nothing intrinsically logical about why a word is masculine or feminine. There are rules. You know, the O ending in Spanish\nor Italian is typically masculine. The ah ending is typically feminine. Those are rules that\nyou can easily look up. It's difficult to remember. It's difficult to produce this\nautomatically when you're speaking. If you, you know, speak a language,\nsay English, which doesn't have gender. So even if you understand the\nrules, which nouns are likely to be masculine or feminine, you may\nstill Not be able to produce that on the fly for a long, long time. So don't worry about it. That's normal. There are grammatical,\nyou know, idiosyncrasies. The Portuguese have a sort of a\npersonalized infinitive, which doesn't exist in the other Romance languages. So you're going to find specific\nthings in each one of these languages, which is different from the others. The subjunctive is fairly common, but the\nrules governing the subjunctive can also be different from language to language. So. You can look at these rules, you can\nbe aware that they're there, but in my experience, it's only through a lot of\nlistening and reading, a lot of exposure, a lot of opportunity to use the language,\nto speak the language poorly and make mistakes that eventually you get better. Another thing that I found was that\nif you are learning very similar languages, like Spanish and Portuguese,\nwhich share 90 percent of the same vocabulary, maybe more pronunciation\nthan usage, I found it difficult. So it's like um, much more difficult\nto convert myself into a speaker of Portuguese from Spanish because\nI've had so much more exposure to Spanish than to Portuguese. There are people however, and I was\njust listening to a video or watching a video the other day put out by language\nsimp where he talks about different languages and he is really very very good. Both in Brazilian\nPortuguese and in Spanish. So there are people who don't\nfind that an obstacle, but I have found it to be an obstacle. So getting back then to this idea of,\nin order to get used to this language, to learn the language, I would recommend\nthe same things that I always recommend. If you're using LingQ,\nget on the mini stories. Lots of high frequency verbs. Listen to them over and over again. My strongest Romance language is French. So if you look at my statistics\nat LingQ, I don't have very many saved words in French. I think it's around 5, 000 and it was\nmore because I was kind of testing out different content items in our library. On the other hand, Spanish,\nPortuguese, Romanian, Italian. You'll see that I've put a\nfair amount of effort into. Acquiring words on LingQ, that\nmeans that I listened a lot. That means I read a lot. And, uh, the advantage, of course, if\nyou are doing more than one romance language, because there's such\nsimilarity in vocabulary, it's very easy to accumulate lots of words. New known words, because you'll\nsee they're slightly, the form is slightly different. The meaning might be slightly different,\nbut it's so much easier to remember these and then to identify the meaning\nor guess at the meaning when you see them in subsequent content that you\nvery quickly acquire a large vocabulary. Very quickly, you're able to understand\nwhat you're listening to and reading. And that's really very encouraging. So if, if you sort of knock off Spanish,\nyou can then go after Portuguese or Italian, as long as you're prepared\nto immerse yourself in that language. Uh, next romance language, you'll find\nit easier to learn in my experience than some languages unrelated. Uh, and that certainly was my,\nuh, experience, for example, with Romanian, where there is the,\nthere's about 70 percent vocabulary, very similar to Italian, but\nthere's 20 percent vocabulary. That is influenced by the Slavic\nlanguages that surround, uh, Romania and Romanian speakers. And there's also some influence of, of,\nI guess, the original languages in that. Part of Europe, but nevertheless, I\nwas able to acquire the language quite quickly because of the 70 percent\nvocabulary that was so similar. Every one of the Romance languages\nis influenced by languages that were spoken around it. So, uh, you know, in the case of Spanish,\nfor example, Arabic has influenced it. Spanish, but by and large, this is affects\na minor percentage of the vocabulary. Overwhelmingly, the vocabulary is very\nsimilar and it's a wonderful thing to do to go in there and go after this\ngroup of languages that have been, you know, quite a big part of certainly the\nWestern world and, and modern culture reflects a lot of the romance, cultural\ninfluences and wine and music and, uh, olive oil and all the good things that\nwe identify with Uh, Latin world and even the classical world of ancient Greece and\nRome, and the two are culturally linked. And in a subsequent video, I may talk\nabout other language groups and explore how the Greek world expanded beyond its\nborders, but I think that'll be enough for now, and so there you have it. My brief rant on Romance languages."

        "title": "Develop a reading habit in 5 simple steps",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about reading, why\nreading is important and specifically how it relates to language learning. But more than that, how do we\ndevelop good reading habits? I love books. I'm surrounded by books. I've got books all over my house. I can't say I've read them all. I've read a lot of them. Sometimes I buy a book\nand I read it later on. I use books a lot for learning\nthe languages that I'm learning. Reading is. It's good for the brain. Research shows that it is very\ngood for our cognitive functions. It creates new connections in the brain. It's not something that humans\ndid for most of our existence, but it's very good for us. It's a big marker of professional\nsuccess, of academic success, but not everyone likes to read and some\npeople don't have that reading habit. We hear a lot these days that young people\naren't reading, that reading is declining, people don't read as well as they used to. So I want to delve into that a little bit. I googled, are young people\nreading less today in a variety of languages, Swedish, German, Japanese,\nFrench, Italian, Turkish even. In fact, I googled it in Turkish\nand found an article, which I then Imported into LingQ so I can read that\nand improve my Turkish while reading. What I discovered is that while there\nis a lot of sort of alarmist, you know, hand wringing about how reading\nskills are declining, in fact, the picture is a little more differentiated\ndepending on how we look at it. First of all, there's always the\nassumption that at some period in the past, everyone was a great reader. That's not the case. In fact, Probably more people read\ntoday than a long time ago, but even compared to the 50s, 60s,\n70s, people read in different ways. Reading is not declining. Uh, you'll see some of these studies\nfrom Sweden and Italy and elsewhere show that young people are reading more, but\nthey read a greater variety of things. things. Our world, our information\nworld has become more varied. One of the interesting observations\nwas that young people don't like the kind of books that are suggested\nto them by teachers or others. Also, it seems that in most countries,\nyoung people read more and then they start to lose that reading habit\nbecause there are more distractions. However, in my view, if you have\nbeen an avid reader as a Very young person, you now have that ability. You can go back to it and you can\nrekindle those reading habits, which we will get into later on. One of the interesting things I came\nupon was a website called Wattpad, which creates sort of a learning\ncommunity online where people can recommend books to each other,\npeople can write for each other. So I, I joined, I thought\nI would try it out. Uh, I'm not sure I'll\nspend much time there. I put nonfiction as my area of interest. And up popped a bunch of books that\nI have absolutely no interest in. Now, granted, this is\na younger demographic. Apparently young people are more\ninterested in things related to fantasy or, or I don't know, science\nfiction, whatever, not my interest. I have to kind of find a Wattpad\nthat corresponds to my age group and my kind of interest. But the key there is if you can\nprovide young readers, middle aged readers with things of interest\nto them, they're going to read. One of the big issues in reading\nhas been the so called reading wars. Like, what is the best\nway to teach reading? This is a war that has been raging\nsince the fifties, if not longer. And it is this sort of disagreement\nas to whether kids should be taught phonics, in other words, to sound out\nthe words based on the value of the letters, or should they be taught phonics? Some kind of a reading strategy based\non remembering words, memorizing words, guessing at the meaning of words. In other words, reading\nthe whole language. Personally, I don't understand\nwhy there is a dispute. I don't see how you can learn to\nread without learning to decode the letters, what the letters stand for. And I don't know how you can become a\ngood reader if you don't read a lot. In other words, absorb the whole. Language and develop a sense of\nfluency of reading and reading a lot. It's a bit like speaking a language. You have to speak a lot to speak well,\nto read well, you have to read a lot. So I really don't see why\nthere is a dispute there. At any rate, this dispute has\nbeen raging for a hundred years. And yet, you know, educators or\npoliticians continue to complain that reading skills are declining despite\nthe, uh, tremendous amount of research and theories about how best to teach\nreading and so forth and so on. It still comes back down to\ndeveloping that reading habit. When it comes to decoding, of course,\ndecoding is a much bigger issue in some languages than in others. If the language is written in a way that\nwe call transparent, such as Spanish or Turkish, where there's literally a, you\ncan read any word, even if you don't know the word, because the relationship between\nhow the word is written and how it's pronounced is very consistent, then those\nlanguages are easier and more transparent. Where that relationship is not quite\nso consistent as in English, notorious example, Danish, as far as I'm concerned,\nArabic and Persian, then it's, it's not obvious and we end up having to try to\nmemorize the word because it's difficult, at least for me, say, reading Persian\nand Arabic, difficult to sound out that word if I haven't seen it before. And I think to some extent\nreaders rely on a combination of decoding and remembering the word. If you have learned to decode English\nand you see The combination of letters O U G H, if you don't know the word,\nyou don't know if that's rough, though, bow, through, you have to know the word. So it's always a combination of\ndecoding and developing some sort of fluency through memorizing words\nonce you've seen them often enough. Again, to become a better reader, you\nhave to read a lot, you become more fluent in terms of decoding, you become more\nfluent in terms of recognizing words. Maybe the bottom line there is that\nwe have to learn to enjoy reading. If we enjoy reading, we\nwill become good readers. That means allowing learners or\nreaders to choose what they want to read, and also allowing them to choose\nthe form in which they want to read. Might be comic books. It might be reading online, which\nmore and more young people are doing. But any form of reading is, in\nfact, building up that capability. So let's look at how we\ndevelop a good reading habit. And I'm going to leave a link to\nan article by James Clear, who wrote Atomic Habits, where he talks\nabout developing a reading habit. I think the philosophy of Atomic\nHabits is very applicable to reading. Every little bit that we read, is good. Atomic Habits talks about the importance\nof not, you know, reaching for the sky, but developing good habits, you know,\nsmall habits that cumulatively benefit us. So we should be, you know, encouraged\nto read wherever we can, in whatever form, even little bits. of reading are all positive. However, there are other things that I do. For example, I always have a book by\nmy bedside because my favorite time to read is before going to sleep. And James Clear mentions this. There is a real benefit in having\nsort of a reading time during the day. In my case, it's a half\nhour before I fall asleep. I may read at other times,\nbut I know I'm going to read. Before going to sleep. And so if we have our reading\ntime, it could be after breakfast. It could be at any time, then that's\ngoing to encourage us to read. It's going to help develop\nthat reading habit. Another thing to have a reading\nhabit, you need to be curious about things, but curiosity is developed\nin a variety of different ways. For example, in my case, audio books help. Trigger an interest in\nreading the same book. It doesn't replace reading. It's another form of\ngetting that information in. But once I've been listening to the\nbook, I actually want to read the book so that I can flip back and forth\nin the book and reread certain parts of it and so forth, which is more\ndifficult to do with an audio book. Also, when I learn Turkish or\nPersian or Arabic, now I'm motivated to read a book about the book. The history of the Arabs or the history\nof Iran or the history of the Turks. So these are all things that\nconnect with each other. Uh, I don't think that the, uh,\navailability of electronic media and, and audio books and eBooks necessarily\ndiscourages people from reading. And I think the statistics bear that out,\nthat despite some alarmist statements, and maybe it varies from country to country. But I don't think reading\nin terms of volume of words read is actually declining. But I think the form that that\nreading takes is changing. And so while all the different kinds\nof reading that we do online and elsewhere and mixing in audio books may\ndistract from reading, however, maybe that word distraction is important. In other words, we do\nneed a certain degree of. Concentration, a big advantage of reading\non paper is that you are less likely to be distracted by your iPhone or your Twitter\nor your email or things of that nature. And if you have problems, if you have,\nuh, you know, difficulty shutting off your, uh, iPhone, my son told me that his\nkids, grandchildren who live in England, they have some kind of an iPhone box\nor something where they lock up their iPhone for three hours, so they cannot\naccess it for that period of time. So any kind of strategy which limits\ndistractions may also encourage you to read more or to stay focused and\nconcentrated while you're reading. And finally, a word about\nreading and language learning. For much of my life, reading has been\nmy main way of learning languages. When I was learning. Mandarin Chinese back in 1968,\nI spent more time reading than doing anything else. There wasn't the availability of audio\nand certainly not video in those days. And so I was reading books, books with\nglossaries, but I was reading books. If I hear a language, if I have my\nlesson with my Turkish tutor and he introduces a new word to me, I\nhave no hope of remembering that word if I don't see it written down. And that's why I get a report later on\nfrom my tutor where he writes out the words and phrases that I struggled with or\nthat he introduced while we were talking. I need to read it. I need to see it. I need that combination of audio and text. Reading is, to my mind, the best\nway to accumulate vocabulary. Listening helps with vocabulary and\nlistening particularly helps you. To get into speaking, but to accumulate\nvocabulary, passive vocabulary, which you can eventually turn into active\nvocabulary, reading is the key. Reading is very important to increase\nour vocabulary, which as I've said many, many times is the key to improving in\nyour, whatever language you're learning. And of course, vocabulary and word count. is at the core of our, uh, language\nlearning philosophy at LingQ. And just a final note, it's surprising\nto me how many systems for language acquisition don't focus on reading. Steven Krashen, of course, is a\ngreat proponent of voluntary reading as a way to acquire language. And, uh, I consider him the foremost\nexpert on language acquisition today. Reading is so important. That even while we are surrounded by\nYouTube videos on learning languages and podcasts about learning languages,\nif a transcript isn't made available, I find those much less useful. So in every way, reading is\nfundamental to language improvement. It's something that obviously I can't do\nwhile driving the car, but it's something that I combine with my listening. Which I am able to do\nwhile doing other tasks. So with that, if you want to improve\nin your language and you recognize the importance of reading, but don't\nhave that reading habit, first of all, I left the link to James Clear's\nsuggestions on developing a reading habit. And I hope that, uh, this little\ntalk might encourage you to become a better reader and more motivated\nto develop a reading habit. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "7 tips for speaking better in any language",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to share with\nyou my seven tips for speaking well in a foreign language. The background to this is\nmy experience with Turkish. I'm going to Turkey with my\nwife in a couple of weeks. Uh, I've been working quite hard at\nTurkish over the last five months. I talked to a tutor now four times a week. First little period, I didn't do that\nso much, but now I've stepped it up. And I would like to speak better\nbecause I continue to stumble. I continue not to get the\nright grammatical form out. And I'm saying, how can I improve? So I thought about this whole issue\nof how we learn languages and how everyone wants to speak better. And a lot of traditional\ninstruction focuses on grammar. So what is the most important thing\nthat in my view, we should be paying attention to if we want to speak better? So. First of all, point number one,\ndon't focus on pronunciation. I've always been far more impressed by\npeople who use the words of the language well, but have a pronounced accent,\ncompared to those people who may have less of an accent, but don't understand\nwell, or don't express themselves well. So as long as you can be understood,\nand as long as the other person is comfortable, comfortable, then\nyour pronunciation is good enough. If you get sort of a expression from\nthe person you're talking to that they don't understand you, then you got\nto try to improve your pronunciation. And I would focus on\nintonation in pronunciation. If you're at LingQ, for example, you\ncan listen to each sentence, hear it spoken, and then try to repeat that\nsentence with a focus on intonation. The actual letters, the guttural R in\nFrench, or the, uh, you know, vowel sounds in different languages, they will\ncome along if you have good intonation. So don't put that much\nimportance on pronunciation. It's not the most important\nthing by any means. I've done business with people\nin English who have accents, but who express themselves well. The pronunciation is not the number one\nthing when it comes to speaking better. Point number two, focus on words. You won't be surprised that I put words\nand vocabulary well ahead of grammar because the language consists of words. When we started LingQ, I said the most\nimportant thing, the most important measure of our capability in a language\nis the number of words we know. Obviously different words have\ndifferent forms and at LingQ we count them as separate words,\nbut we have to get into words. We have to surround ourselves with words. We have to like words. We have to see how words\nconnect with each other. Uh, you know, there are components\nof words in different languages, which reappear in other words,\nwhich have the same components. We have to get into the mood, the\nfeeling that we want to increase our familiarity with words. That doesn't necessarily\nmean always remembering them. It means exposing ourselves to them. That's how AI works. There's such a massive exposure to\nvarious corpuses of language that the artificial intelligence can\npredict what's going to happen. And that's the same thing with us. If we have had enough words,\nwe are able to predict what's going to happen in the language. And eventually that\nenables us to speak better. Tip number three, don't do things that\nare stressful and that increase your level of stress when using the language. In other words, don't spend too much\ntime on conjugation tables, doing drills. declension tables, trying to memorize\nrules of grammar, because these will fail you when you go to speak. These are stressful. These force you to start to think of\nthe rule when you're trying to speak. Well, actually, what has to happen is\nthat you have had enough exposure to the language that not only are you predicting\nhow the language is supposed to be, you're actually producing the language correctly. And if you have a lot of words, you're\nactually You can pull out of your bag a word that works in this situation and\nthat'll keep the conversation going. So don't spend a lot of time creating\nstress for yourself by trying to remember the definition of when to\nuse this tense versus that tense. It is not going to help\nyou to speak correctly. It's only going to increase your stress. Your stress level. Tip number four. Think of grammar, not so much as a set\nof rules that determine how you are supposed to use the language or speak. Rather, grammar is a description of\nthe usage patterns in the language. So it's the usage patterns that\ndetermine what the grammar is. And that usage pattern evolves over time. That's why we have, you know, the\nRomance languages of today, which were once, uh, Latin or various dialects\nof Latin couple of thousand years ago. And, uh, the way, for example, in\nFrench or in in Spanish, the future and the conditional is formed is\nbased on a combination of a verb for, let's say, to love with a verb to have\nand combine together that eventually became the future or the conditional. You can Google this and\nsee it for yourself. Things are constantly evolving. Right now, for example, many people\nsay, I would have went, which I can't stand hearing, but it's probably\ngoing to become standard usage. Very few people use the\nword whom in English. I hear people say, I am\nwaiting on something to happen. To me, waiting on means\nworking in a restaurant. I'm waiting for is what I grew up with. The word wait either had the meaning\nof you're expecting something to happen or you're serving someone. And waiting on was. But nowadays that's changed. So usage changes in every language, usage\nchanges, and we want to get enough of the language in us that we get used to the\nusage pattern that is most relevant to us. So if you are living in Quebec or if\nyou're living in Paris, usage patterns that will be relevant and useful will\nbe different in those two locations and similar examples in other languages. So. Getting used to the language, getting\nused to the usage patterns is probably, in the long run, going to be more effective\nthan trying to remember rules of grammar. Hint number five. Fortunately, the usage patterns\nin any language are limited. So, whereas the number of words\nyou can use and learn is not quite limitless, but a vast number. But the Usage patterns of the language,\nnot only just grammar rules, you know, declensions and so forth, but even\nwhich words are used with which words, these patterns are not limitless. When I was learning Russian,\nI did a book called, uh, 52 Patterns in the Russian Language. 52, that's a limited number of\npatterns that you have to get used to. If you can actually use these\npatterns in the language, you will cover most situations. And it's always, I find when I'm\nspeaking in a foreign language, if I can trot out a pattern that I'm very\ncomfortable using, that I know that works, that really helps me, and I\ncan sort of direct my conversation. Around these patterns. So the good thing about learning\nusage patterns is that there's a limited number of them. And it's easier to get used to these\nusage patterns by a lot of exposure and paying attention to them when\nyou read them and hear them, rather than trying to remember rules and\ntrying to apply rules while speaking. Now, number six, always circle back. Don't think you're going to\nlearn anything on the first pass. I have often said that I use\nthe mini stories at LingQ to get started in a language. And I might spend three months on\nthe mini stories before branching out into more interesting content,\nwhich I can import into LingQ. However, I regularly go\nback to my mini stories. It's almost like going to the gym. Right now in Turkish, I go\nback to my mini stories. Which I've listened to 30, 40\ntimes over the course of, you know, a long period of time. I'm always amazed at the number of\npatterns that I suddenly noticed that I hadn't noticed before. Or words that I kind of half knew\nbut didn't really focus in on. If I go back to those many\nstories, if I go back to, uh, things that I've done before. Maybe even re reading an old grammar book. Because I do read grammar\nbooks occasionally. to sort of remind me of certain\nthings in the language, particularly once I have enough experience with\nthe language that these grammar explanations start to make sense to me. So remember, you're going to have\nto circle back many, many times. And don't be afraid to circle back. Don't feel as if you're wasting your time. If you circle back and so finally point\nnumber seven is we want to speak better. However, in order to speak\nbetter, we have to make mistakes. There is no avoiding it. You have to speak a lot\nin order to speak well. And speaking a lot means that\nyou cannot wait until you are perfect before you start speaking. That means you're going to\nstart speaking a lot with a lot. of mistakes. Learn to enjoy your mistakes. Learn to recognize that it's plowing\nthrough this period where you seem to make the same mistakes over and over again. In talking to my Turkish tutors,\nI've always, you know, have trouble with the same Turkish verbs. The same structures give me trouble. But I know from personal experience\nthat eventually I'll get better. And the only way to get better is to\ncontinue speaking and continue learning. And that kind of brings to my summary,\nwhich is, in order to speak well, which is a subjective definition,\nyou speak well enough that the other person is comfortable, you are\ncomfortable, or maybe not totally comfortable, but you know you have\ncommunicated, that to me is well enough. And if you continue doing that,\nyou will eventually get better. But the key is, you have to stay with it. So therefore, you have to enjoy. You have to enjoy what you're doing. You have to enjoy the way you speak the\nlanguage, even with the mistakes that you make, don't let that frustrate you because\nultimately those people who give up and who abandon never learn to speak well. Those people who continue making\nmistakes and slowly improve, they eventually achieve their language goals. So I hope that was helpful. Seven tips, at least from my\nown experience, of how we can speak better in a language. Thanks for listening."

        "transcript": "What are the ideal characteristics that\nI see when it comes to a language tutor? It used to be that to learn a language,\nto find a tutor, you had to go to school. Now there's all kinds of people offering\nlanguage tutoring services online. Italki is perhaps the best known,\nbut there are many places where you can find the tutor, including LingQ. Different rates they charge. They have different skill\nsets, different personalities, obviously for different languages. And I say this because I am now in preparation for going to Turkey in October. I am engaging with the tutors\nmore than I have in the past. I've got my sort of basic passive\nvocabulary up to a level where I want to use the language more. And I'm going or have been going\nroughly with two tutors twice a week with each one of them. So that's four sessions a week. Each session is an hour or so long. And, uh, of course, again, with\nother languages, I have tutors. I've had tutors in Persian. I've had tutors in Arabic. So I have had some experience with\nthe kinds of people who are available. And most of the online tutors I\nhave found to be very pleasant, very engaging, very serious, and very helpful. So what are the most important things? Important characteristics, either\nfrom the perspective of a learner or from the perspective of someone who\nwants to start, uh, tutoring online. To me, the most important characteristic\nof a successful and effective language tutor is that that person be sympathetic,\nthat the learner likes the tutor, and that the tutor seems to like the learner. That is the number one characteristic. In other words. The learner has to want to go back\nand meet with the tutor again. And that has certainly been the case\nwith the tutors that I have had. That's the case with\nmy two Turkish tutors. It was the case with my Persian tutor. I looked forward to our next session. It's not like, gee, I have to\nspend an hour with that person now. And in fact, you end up\nalmost wanting to perform. You want to show the tutor that you've\nactually made a little bit of progress. And the hour goes very, very\nquickly if you have the right tutor. So, first of all, you have to like\nthe tutor, the tutor has to like you. That's the number one characteristic\nof a successful online language tutor. Now, the second thing is that the\ntutor has to be a good listener. I have had tutors in the\npast who wanted to talk. I have access to all kinds\nof listening material. I don't need to listen to the tutor. I want to talk with the tutor. I want to engage in a conversation with\nthe tutor on a subject of interest. So that in the course of an hour,\nWithin that sort of limited range of what I can say, we are able to have an\ninteresting, meaningful conversation. That's very important to me. That's why I don't engage with a\ntutor until I'm able to some extent to have a meaningful conversation\non subjects of interest to me. With gaps, with missing words,\nwith mistakes, with whatever, but at least I have the feeling\nthat I'm having a conversation and that's extremely important. So therefore the tutor\nhas to be a good listener. That means that when I make a\nmistake, the tutor cannot show impatience, and I've had that. You know, or disappointment, or you\nknow, kind of, why are you so stupid? In other words, the tutor should just\nlet the mistakes fly by, and I'll mention later how we capture the mistakes in the\nreport that the tutor gives me later on. But while we're conversing, I want\nto have the feeling that the tutor actually enjoys speaking with me. Which may or may not be the case,\nbut at least the tutor gives the impression that he or she is happy to\nbe engaged in a conversation with you. And the tutor offers you something\nthat's very valuable and that is the opportunity to speak because\nthe listening and the reading opportunity, I have a limitless amount. So I mentioned the tutor's reports\nand I just thought I'd show you what it actually looks like. So conversation reports is actually a\ncourse and I can open this up and I can see all the conversation reports that\nI've had going back however long it's been that I've been learning Turkish. But first, let me show you\nhow I get the tutor reports. I always get a notification in my\nemail, but the notification in the email directs me to my, uh, activities. And if I go to activities, and I\nclick on activities, then I will see both the conversations that I have\nlined up with my tutors, as well as conversation reports that I have received. So I can go to this conversation\nreport, and I see it here. Uh, these are sentences that contain,\ncontain some of the errors that I. Made in our conversation, uh,\nbut I can also import it as a lesson and that's how it becomes\na part of my conversation course. So, and here, I have again\nwords that I can look up, look up, and so forth and so on. I can also, of course, go\nthrough sentence views. I have trouble with this word,\nkarselars, karselarshterelsak, comparing, or if we compare. And I can listen to it now. If we compare it with Farsi,\nTurkish is an easier language. Because Turks use the Latin alphabet.\nSo compared to Farsi, Turkey is easier. It's an easier language because\nTurkish uses the Latin alphabet. Now, if I want to like review this\nsentence, I can try to put the whole sentence together again. So if we compare it with Farsi, If\nwe compare it with Farsi, T\u00fcrk\u00e7e daha kolay bir dil \u00e7\u00fcnk\u00fc T\u00fcrkler\nLatin alfabesini kullan\u0131yor. So that kind of gives me a chance to delve\ndeeper into sentences that I might have been struggling with during my lesson. And of course if I go back to my\nmain page here, the lesson page, and I can see my conversation reports. Of course here, and it's\nnot in any particular order. But I can, of course, put it in an\norder, oldest to newest, last open, newest percentage, whatever I want. Typically, I look at this\nnewest to oldest, but sometimes. I might do it some other way. The third thing is when it comes\nto the structure and the grammar and the correctness of speech and\nall of these other aspects of the language, it's important that the\ntutor would not be too didactic. In other words, I've had tutors who\nperhaps they were recent graduates of some language teaching school, you know,\nT E F L or whatever it might be for in the case of English, and they say,\nokay, today we're going to cover This, or we're going to cover the numbers, or\nwe're going to cover the subjunctive. Or in other words, the tutor\ntries to dictate what they want to cover in the lesson. I react very poorly to that. When teachers have, or tutors have come at\nme with that, I've said, okay, I will give them a chance to try it, do it their way. And I'm always disappointed. And I find that less effective. I can get a grammar book. I can look grammar up. I don't need to have a sort of\nteacher teaching me the grammar. That's not the main purpose. The main purpose for me is to have\na natural conversation where I see the gaps in my knowledge and where\nthe tutor can guide me and a very skilled tutor will be able to keep the\nconversation going despite the problems that I have, the gaps, the lack in my\nvocabulary that just keep me talking. If I, as a learner, and, and it does come\nup, like, why is it this and why that? And here are three words that\nseem to have the same meaning. How are they different? And I will ask those questions\nand I will get an explanation, which I'll probably forget. However, if I'm interested in\nsomething, I'll ask for it, but I don't want the tutor to impose\nan agenda or an explanation or today we're going to cover this. I don't want that. Tutors should be flexible,\nengaging, interesting. A clever tutor will see where I have\nproblems of structure or vocabulary and they'll bring the conversation\nback to something where I have to try to use that structure again and\nthen they will capture that in the report with more and more examples. Remember, whatever mistake I make,\nand even if the tutor kind of repeats it correctly, and I'm kind of pick\nup on it a little bit, but I will continue to make those same mistakes. That's just the nature\nof language learning. We continue making the same mistakes,\nwhether we're corrected or not, whether things are explained to us or not,\nwe continue making the same mistakes because it's one thing to understand. In theory, how the language is\nsupposed to work, it's quite another thing to actually execute that, to\nuse that structure or those words correctly when you are speaking. That requires a lot of practice\nin a natural environment. So from that point of view, it's\nvery important that the tutor provide examples while we're speaking and also\nin the report that the tutor circles back to the same types of errors that\nI will continue to make week after week and that the tutor has the patience. to do this. Another thing that a very good tutor does\nis the tutor will either create content, as was the case with Sahra, who created\nthat wonderful series we have on the history of Iran, and many other content\nitems as well that we have in our Persian library, or the tutor will help me find\nthe content, perhaps a website where I can download audio or just Text material. In other words, the tutor takes\nan interest in helping you build up your compelling input\nthat you can use for learning. So the tutor is not just someone\nwho's going to teach the language or allow you to engage in conversation. The teacher actually\nhelps you find an answer. You know, learning content\nthat's going to help you. And finally, and this is something\nthat's perhaps more specific to, to LingQ where we're trying to improve\nour tutoring function and create sort of a list of LingQ accredited tutors\nwho understand the LingQ system. who follow the learners statistics,\nwho have an understanding of how LingQ works, who can help the\nlearner get more out of LingQ. Sort of a range of call it hand\nholding and coaching in the language and in LingQ that goes beyond just\nthe hour that is spent with the tutor. And, uh, certainly the Tutors that I've\nbeen using, uh, for Turkish are very familiar with LingQ and that helps make\nmy session more useful and rewarding. They're well aware that their report\nto me will be a lesson for me in LingQ, that I'm going to import it, that I'm\ngoing to go through the errors, the examples, uh, so that I have an ongoing,\nuh, you know, benefit from the lesson. And also all of these lessons are part\nof a course then that I can then go back to three months earlier, reviewing. What was covered in a lesson back\nthen, and, and, you know, continue to improve and lessen because\ninevitably we have to circle back. We have to circle back. We don't learn something and then it's\nno, we learn it and forget it, learn it, forget it, don't really learn\nit, come back to it, and eventually slowly, slowly these things sock in. And I think a good tutor should\nbe aware of these things. One other thing, it has often come\nby, come up, you know, does the tutor have to be a native speaker? Matter of preference, I would\nnot like to learn a language from a non native speaker. If I'm learning Turkish, I don't\nwant to learn it from a German, from an American, from a Chinese person. I want to learn it from a Turkish person. However, I know there are a\nlot of non native speakers. There are arguments out there that\nthe tutor who has learned the language is more familiar with some of the\npitfalls and difficulties that may be. And I think it's a matter of learning. A personal preference, but in my case,\nit's more inspiring to speak Turkish with a Turkish person, Chinese with\nthe Chinese person, and so forth. It's their language, it's their culture. And so that motivates me more. And motivation is such an important\npart of language of learning that I prefer a native speaker. However, obviously there are schools\nall over the world where non native speakers are teaching English or French. And, and I've had, you know, when\nI was at school, we had non native speakers, uh, teaching French. If you're stuck there in the\nclassroom, that's what you get. But if you have a choice, my choice\nis a native speaker of the language. Now you can Google and find different,\nuh, recommendations of, uh, Uh, what makes a good online tutor. And some of these recommendations\nare that you should make sure they cover all the four language skills. I don't believe in any of that. I think an unstructured class that\nyou enjoy, that you look forward going back to, and where you feel that you're\nsupported by a sympathetic tutor, that's far more important than any sort of\nformalized structure, teach the four skills or any of these other things\nthat I found browsing the internet for suggestions on what makes a good tutor. So I hope you find that useful. Thanks for listening."

        "title": "The worst thing about being a polyglot",
        "transcript": "The other day on Twitter, I saw this\nvideo of an Iraqi Christian speaking in standard Arabic, Fusha, and I was very\nencouraged to see that I understand, or I understood basically everything\nhe was saying, helped a little by the subtitles, but I heard the words. I could understand him, even though I\nhaven't spent that much time on standard Arabic, but time I've spent on Arabic,\nI've spent on Lebanese Arabic in the last year or so, plus I've been working\non my Turkish, not to mention my Farsi. And so then this made me think about this\nwhole issue of, you know, what are the pros and cons of learning many languages? And of course, in my case, it's not\njust the three languages that I've been working on over the last few years. But, you know, throughout the period of\ntime that I've been learning languages, these languages are there in my brain. And what are the advantages and\ndisadvantages, pros and cons of learning different languages? So I want to talk a little bit about that. First point is, to me, a language is,\nor learning a language is not just about being able to say a few things\nto someone, say, in a restaurant or, uh, in a store or whatever. It's more about learning about those\nlanguages, the history behind those languages, the cultures, and so forth. It's a form of discovering\nthe world that I live in. People who share this planet with me, uh,\nyou know, while I'm Here sort of alive. So to that extent, obviously, the\nmore languages I learn, the more doors open up, the more things I learn. And going back to this Iraqi\nChristian, what's the history of the Christians in Iraq? Well, it turns out they're one of\nthe oldest Christian churches in the world, which is not surprising since\nChristianity began in the Middle East. And spread eastward\nbefore it spread westward. Also, when you talk about Iraqi\nChristians, you're talking about Iraq. You're talking about a part of the\nworld that was under the Sasanian or Persian empire for a long, long time. So it brings you into that Persian world,\nwhich I've also been learning about. So I'm just kind of stressing the fact\nthat discovering different languages is about discovering so many different\nthings that obviously the more you have, the more languages you have, the\nmore different things you learn about. Even though you may not get into\ntremendous depth in any of them, but by, you know, the connection to Arabic. So we have Christian Arabs. We also have Muslim Arabs. And of course, as we learn about\nthe Muslim world, as I do, I learn about Khorasan, for example, which\nwas an area in central Asia where there was this tremendous flowering\nof culture, uh, in the sort of. 8th, 9th, 10th century to some\nextent in Baghdad, but more so in what is now Turkmenistan,\nUzbekistan, Tajikistan, Eastern Iran. They in turn influenced and had\na large amount of power within the, uh, Abyssinian, you know,\nuh, Caliphate in, in Baghdad. And there are elements\nof Turkish culture there. And so I'm also learning\nTurkish, the Turkish language. So not to mention the fact that that\npart of the, uh, Muslim world was translating Greek science, uh, science\nfrom India, uh, Arabic science. So there was a great blending\nof cultures taking place there. Something that I was\ncompletely unaware of. And I should add that because of\ntheir work and translating these ancient texts, it contributed\nto the development of science in Europe in the Renaissance period. So we access this, or at least I do. So for me, from that perspective,\nthe more the merrier. However, what about from the point\nof view of learning languages? What are the advantages and disadvantages\nof having many languages in your brain or trying to learn them? First of all, I want to\naddress the issue of whether. We should learn many languages at\nthe same time or concentrate on one. I kind of vacillate back and forth. I think there are some\npros and cons there. Obviously, if you focus on one,\nif you're in a hurry to learn it, you're going to learn it faster. On the other hand, if you have two\nor three on the go, you're enjoying that experience of exploring and\nbeing able to refresh, moving from one language where you might\nfeel you're not getting anywhere. You start up that other language\nand you discover new things. So it's simply a matter of taste. So I won't address the issue of whether. It's best to study one language, you\nknow, for a period of time, concentrate, focus, or to, you know, have two or\nthree on the go at the same time. I'm inclining now towards the first\nsolution, but I think people should experiment, but rather in terms of\nthe ease or difficulty of learning. So to my mind, if you have a\nlot of languages, I think the brain becomes more flexible. So in an extreme case, you only\nhave your native language, then the brain, your brain has sort of\nsolidified around pronunciation, around structures, vocabulary that\nare part of your native language. So the new language is strange. When you have more languages, you\nhave a wider range of knowledge. Sounds, call it phonemes, in your\nbrain, you have a wider range of structures, things are not so strange. And therefore, you can accept\nthem more easily, you don't resist them, you're more flexible. So to that extent, I think that's a big\nadvantage of having lots of languages. I also think that, uh, we become\nmore confident as we have learned. You know, more and more languages. We have now more and more\nsounds, more and more structures. We're more confident that we can do it. We're more convinced that we can\ndo it so that our attitude is more positive than with our first language,\nwhen we're not entirely sure we can ever get fluent in another language. So to that extent, it's, it's,\nyou know, the more, the merrier. But having a lot of languages\nis not without its problems. So we sometimes hear people\nsay, beware of cognates. In other words, words that look\nthe same as in another language, but have a different meaning. I have never found that to be a problem. Overwhelmingly, the cognates are going\nto have more or less the same meaning, uh, because you know, the words in\nthe new language that are similar to words that you know, I find it\neasier to remember them, even if they have a slightly different meaning. So the word in. Turkish means but, whereas in Persian\nand Arabic it means only, but it's an easy one to remember because\nyou're familiar with that sound. It has a slightly different meaning. So cognates to me is not a problem. The bigger problem though, is the\ninterference from languages you know. So when I am struggling to say something,\nI find myself in my Turkish discussions. I often say, and very\noften I'll say enfin. From French, which is kind of like,\nyou know, so often, and I'll just say often because there's some pressure to\nsay something in a foreign language. I say often, I found, uh, based on my\nresearch that if we have many languages in our brain, they're there all the time. So this one researcher pointed\nout that, and he's Belgian. So if he's speaking English\nand he uses the word dog, but the word chien is still there. So there is a need. When we're speaking a new\nlanguage to suppress the words or structures that don't belong. And apparently that's a\nbig part of what we do. When we go to speak in a new language,\nwe trot out words that come to mind. We trot out structures that we're\nconfident that we can use because we've used them before, but at\nthe same time we have to suppress. We have to suppress\nthings that don't belong. Those things might be from our\nnative language, but very often they're from an unrelated language. I sometimes find my brain going\nto Korean when I'm trying, trying to say something and. Persian or, you know, totally\nunrelated and for no good reason, but I have no real control over\nthe, what, what the brain is doing. So this need to suppress things\nthat don't belong could be a bit of a pitfall when you have a lot of\nlanguages bouncing around in your brain. On the other hand, it turns out that\nour ability to learn languages and even our sort of executive function\nin the brain is Very much improved by the sort of learning many languages. So apparently this connectivity between\ndifferent parts of the brain, and again, I will leave the link so you\ncan research it yourself because it's full of abbreviations and acronyms\nand terms that I don't understand. But the general idea seems to me to be\nthat if you have two languages or even more languages that, That is increased\nconnectivity in the brain, which is good for the executive function of the brain. It's good for learning languages. In other words, it improves\nyour ability to learn languages. So over and above what I said earlier\nabout my experience that I have more flexibility when it comes to sounds, more\nflexibility when it comes to structures, more willing to accept new ways of saying\nthings, more confident that I can learn. There's something that happens in\nthe brain that is very positive when it comes to learning. And in fact, if you look up\nthese links, you'll see that it is positive also in terms of\nmaintaining the health of your brain. And if that is true for bilinguals,\nI, I assume it's got to be at least true and perhaps more so\nthe case with multilinguals. So if you have a lot of languages\nin your brain, yeah, there could be some interference, maybe more\ninterference because you have more languages there, but it does improve\nyour ability to learn languages. Yeah. to produce the utterances\nin the new language. And it has a, you know, a healthy\neffect on your brain, it turns out. However, you know, as with so much\nin language learning, I can't prove that learning many languages makes\nyou a better language learner, that it's better for your brain. Obviously, if I see studies that\ncome to those conclusions, I feel happy and I share them with you\nand it may or may not be the case. It doesn't affect my attitude\nwhen I learn a language. When I learn a language,\noverwhelmingly, I'm going to learn it. I try to enjoy what I'm doing. So if I feel like moving\nto a new language, I move. If I feel like spending more time,\nsay, uh, at LingQ, this morning, for example, I was going through the,\nuh, sentence mode and rearranging the sentences, the words in sentence mode. And then, because it's easier to write\nTurkish than to write Arabic, and where I have sort of resisted writing in\nArabic or Persian, in Turkish it's not difficult because it's the Latin alphabet. So I found myself now trying to write\nby hand those very sentences that I had gone through in sentence mode. So, again, I found it enjoyable. So if it's enjoyable, I'm happy doing it. I'm, you know, acquiring fewer words. And I've always said that the, the,\nthe Key battle is to acquire more words, but you also have to focus in\non, you know, getting better at the language, how the language works. And, uh, I was very much enjoying, you\nknow, by hand writing out the sentences. And I think there, again, the\nmessage is do what you like to do. If you enjoy your involvement with\nthe language, you're going to learn. If you prefer to stay with\none language, that's fine. If you want to explore many\nlanguages, that's fine. But I did feel I should share with\nyou what I consider to be the. Uh, advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are that you can explore more\nworlds, discover more about our world. Possibly you're more open to\nnew sounds and new structures. On the other hand, you have to be a little\ncareful that you don't lose your focus. That you might find a little\nmore interference from the languages that you have learned. But overwhelmingly, I think having a\nlot of languages is a positive thing. So for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "80/20 rule: learn any language with the Pareto principle",
        "transcript": "Hi, today I want to talk about the Pareto\nprinciple, or the 80 20 principle, and how it applies to language learning. We often hear it said that a\nsmall number of words, 500, 1000, account for 70 80 percent of the\nvocabulary in any given language. And therefore people suggest that if\nwe focus in on these high frequency words that we will be able to short\ncircuit our language learning. So that's what I'm going to get into. First let's look at the Pareto\nprinciple, where it came from. So Pareto, Vilfredo Pareto was a professor\nof economics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland back in the early 1900s. And he discovered that in Italy,\n80 percent of the land was owned by 20 percent of the people. He then noticed that the same\nwas true in other countries. And of course, inequality of wealth,\ninequality of incomes is a factor of life today, and I'll show you these\ntwo maps, one for income distribution, which is a little different from\nthe maps of wealth distribution, but in all countries, when it comes to\nwealth, 20 percent of the population controls between 60 to 80 or more\npercent of the wealth in that country. So that's. Still is the case today. However, the Pareto principle and this\n80 20 rule has become more important or more people pay attention to it\ntoday as a means to address problems in production and quality control. And that's because of a professor Juran\nimmigrant from Romania, who in the United States, States started using this\n80 20 principle to address engineering issues and quality control issues. And he talked about the most useful\n20%, but then also accepted the fact that the remaining 80 percent were\nstill important or at least helpful. And that again, has application to\nlanguage learning in terms of how we deal with high frequency words and the\nvery important low frequency words. But insofar as the 80 20\nprinciple, we've seen it applied in so many different situations. A small percentage of criminals. Commit most of the crime, a small\npercentage of the population are occupying most of the hospital beds. In computing, it was said that if you\ncan fix the 20 percent most serious bugs in a piece of software, You'll\nhave dealt with most of the problems. Conversely, it said that 80\npercent of the code can be written in 20 percent of the time. But the corollary to that is you\nspend 80 percent of your time trying to finalize that 20 percent of\nthe code that has to be written. And so this again has application\nfor language learning, where we will end up spending most of our time\ndealing with low frequency language. Words, even though the high frequency\nwords account for the bulk of the content of any particular context. Let's move on then to how I use the 80\n20 rule in my own language learning. And I'm going to refer to my Turkish,\nbut I think it applies to all languages. So first of all, let's deal\nwith the idea of vocabulary. So the most frequent 500 words,\n1000 words account for 70, 80%. Of any given context. What can we draw from that? What I draw from that is I needn't\nmake any special effort to focus in on those high frequency words, because\nthey're going to show up anyway. I know that down the road, I'm going to\nhave to focus and spend a lot of time on learning the Less frequent words, the high\nfrequency words I needn't worry about, they're going to show up and I'm going\nto gradually get used to them anyway. To some extent, the same is true\nwith structures in the language. You could Google and look at, the\napplication of Pareto principle or 80 20 rule to language learning. You can Google the most frequent errors or\ndifficulties that people have in Spanish, English, Chinese And you can say, okay,\nI'm going to look at examples of other people who focus in on the main problems\nthat they experience with the language. But here again, my experience is\nbasically in the Slavic languages. I know it's cases it's aspects\nof verbs of motion that caused me difficulty in Turkish. It's the verbs. There's so many different\nforms of the verbs. I think verbs are usually there\nas a major area of difficulty, but prepositions, case endings. Pronouns, there's any number of different\nthings that can cause the bulk of the problems that we encounter in grammar. But again, my experience has been\nthat I will eventually come across those in all kinds of different\ncontexts and gradually get used to them so that focusing in on those\nspecifically may be of limited benefit. However, 20 rule in my language\nlearning is to tell myself, how am I going to spend my time? I have spoken before of what I\nwould call big picture learning. Input learning, consuming a lot of\nthe language, top down learning. And then there is this bits and\npieces focusing in on, it might be the case endings in Slavic languages. It might be verb endings in\nRomance languages or pronouns in Italian or whatever it might be. It's not that I don't do that. I do some of that. I do look up grammar\nexplanations online or in a book. I have my lessons with my tutor. So I do spend time on the nuts and bolts. But 80 percent of my time\nis spent absorbing the language and acquiring words. And the reason for that is that if\nI have a lot of words, then I can access more interesting content. I can actually understand some of the\nexamples of structures in the language. So that as I go forward in the language,\nwhat's holding me back Is lack of words and the words, which includes a\nlot of low frequency words, they are acquired through the 80 percent big\npicture, top down input based learning. So it's not that I don't do any\nsort of bits and pieces learning. I do some, but I try to\nlimit the amount of time. I spend on that, for example,\nwith my Turkish learning. So I started back in 2018. You can see from this graph\nthat in an initial period, I spent a lot of time listening. You can see my statistics from my playlist\nthat I've listened to the mini stories. In fact, initially I spent most of my time\nwith the mini stories to get a sense of the language, to get some words in me. to get a toehold in the language,\nlistening 30, 40 times to the same mini story, not at the same time,\nbut eventually, because I go back to them and I go back to them. And so that was in a way,\nbig picture learning because the language was new to me. So I was just bombarding my brain\nwith the language, occasionally looking at explanations. Of course, I bought grammar books,\nbut that was five years ago. Now, when I started up again in\npreparation for my trip to Turkey, I'm saying, I've got to dramatically\nincrease my vocabulary because I want to be dealing with things of interest. And so that my major emphasis\nfor the last little while has been on increasing my vocabulary. And yet, when I talked to my tutor,\nI realized how much difficulty I have in some of the most basic patterns\nin the language, how much difficulty I have in producing, verb forms. As I'm now a month away from going to\nTurkey, I've decided to spend a little more time on the bits and pieces. And I do that by going back into my\nmini stories, where there's a lot of focus on verbs, high frequency verbs. And so when I go to them now again,\nI'm discovering things, noticing things that I didn't notice before. Because after a while, if we're\nlistening to the same thing over and over again, We are noticing less and less. So after an absence, then I go back. Another thing to remember is, even if back\nfive years ago, I thought I had learned something, or thought I could remember\na verb, or a word, or a verb form, chances are, I can't remember it now. So we have to be aware of the fact that\nwhatever we do, It's a little bit elusive. We won't necessarily be able\nto grab it and hold onto it. And so therefore I think\nit's very important. And I always make sure that I mix the\nbig picture with the bits and pieces. So even now, when I say I'm going to\nspend more time with my mini stories, it's still a small amount of time because\nby the time I'm on my third mini story, my brain isn't paying much attention. So when I switch back to my history of\nthe Turks or the novel Havanen itch. Cause even though I don't understand\nit all that well, I'm more motivated. I'm more, I'm hanging onto the words\nand then I can go through them in LingQ. Another thing that's useful, I find,\nagain, varying that big picture with the bits and pieces is to\ndo, the sentence review where I have to reassemble the sentence. That's particularly good with\nthe mini stories because the mini stories sentences are short. I have heard them many times and then I\ncan start to put those sentences together. It's a form of being focused\nin on how the language works. How the verbs work, how the genitive\nworks, all these things that I have. So I try to maintain a good balance\nbetween big picture learning and bits and pieces learning. And perhaps beyond the idea that I want\nto maintain a balance of 80 whatever it might be, between big picture and\nbits and pieces learning, at the same time, I asked myself, am I enjoying it? When we start out in a language,\nwe have a high tolerance for relatively repetitive, uninteresting\ncontent like the mini stories. There's a sense of achievement\nas we understand a little bit more and a little bit more. We often think we've learned something\nthat we can maybe now use and we discover we can't use it because it's somehow\nback there in the brain somewhere, you can't bring it out when you need it. But am I enjoying it? And when I stop enjoying it, then I\nmove on to more difficult content. And there again, going\nthrough in sentence mode, but. Learning about the Turks, about\nCentral Asia, about the Balkans, about Anatolia, about whatever it\nmight be, or as in the case of this Three Daughters of Eve, learning\nabout some of the, social and almost psychological issues of modern day Turks. So that's interesting. So my guide is, am I\nenjoying what I'm doing? And if I'm enjoying what I'm\ndoing, then I keep doing it. When I now find it Too frustrating\nto continue in content that has so many unknown words and that\nI would be happier or feel more comfortable being in easier content,\nthen I move back to easier content. But by and large, I think I try to\nmaintain at least 80 percent of my time with big picture top down learning,\nbut not neglect the 20%, 10, 15 percent of time that I need to spend\non focusing in on the bits and pieces. So I hope that was helpful. I've left some links here on the subject\nto a Wikipedia article on the subject, and I'm curious how all of you use the 80\n20 principle in your language learning. Bye for now."

        "title": "How to use ChatGPT to learn a language: tips and prompts",
        "transcript": "Have you used ChatGPT for\nyour language learning? I'm asking you that because I was\nbrowsing the internet on YouTube and there was a video from someone,\nand I'll leave a link here, showing how to use ChatGPT for Spanish. And he used it in several\nways, which got me to thinking. One of which was to ask ChatGPT\nto write a story, I think using the 200 most frequently used or\nmost common words of Spanish. And so there's a part of the\nvideo that talks about that. And then he has a part of the video\nwhere he talks about how he speaks to chat GPT and a very robot like\nvoice engages in a dialogue with him. So I'm not a strong fan of either\nof these things, but I will tell you what, inspired by that. I then went and explored a bit. In my Turkish, first of all, I'll update\nyou, I've been doing a number of things. I've been listening to a lot of self\nhelp podcasts, and I'll leave a link to the podcast that I've been listening\nto, and this is a podcast where they review popular self help books. Now, each of the podcasts\nis five minutes or so long. I'm able to go through them and knock\noff, before even starting into it, a lot of Vocabulary beforehand, then,\nread through the video in Turkish. And sometimes I'll review the words\nafterwards, but because it's all about self help, the vocabulary is quite\nsimilar from one episode to the next. He's talking about some of the same things\nabout how to organize your life, how to get up early, how to plan and develop\ngood habits and all of these things. So I said to myself, Hey, maybe\nthat's a good sort of type of content to use for learning. any language. So then I went to my chat GPT and\nI said to myself, why don't I ask chat GPT to write me a thousand word\nsummary of atomic habits in Turkish? And I don't believe it's necessary to\nspecify the most common words because if chat GPT is going to try to shrink\nthe book down to a thousand words. And it ended up with 750 words. It's going to basically\nsimplify the vocabulary. That's going to happen naturally. You don't have to force chat GPT\nto just use high frequency words. But I did that. Of course, I don't have natural audio,\nbut I have the artificial audio for it, but I can go in and I can take,\nthe 10 bestselling self help books in English and ask chat GPT to write a\nsummary of a thousand words in French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, you name it. Polish, and I'll have that, and I can\ngo through there, and it's going to be a lot of relatively high frequency\nwords, relatively meaningful words that appear often in self help type books. Obviously, it's better if you have a\npodcast series summarizing self help books because you get the natural audio. But if the goal is through LingQ,\nwhere you can get a summary produced by ChatGPT, import it into LingQ, learn\nall the words and phrases, that's still a very useful activity in my opinion. So I'm going to do that. So there's one example of how I\nuse ChatGPT to create meaningful content for me, as long as you\ndon't have to read all 300 pages. If you can get it summarized, it's\nquite interesting to see what some of these popular self help books are\nsaying, and to see it in the language that you're learning, and to study\nit on LingQ, and look up the words. And by doing this, by the way, with\nthe Turkish podcast series, I'm really cranking up my known words total. Now, granted again, Turkish, a lot of\nwords have 10 different forms, but I'm already at the 25, 000 known words. And I started whenever it was the\nbeginning of June, I was at 8, 000 words. So I'm able to really add\nto my known words total. So that's working very well. So then I said, chat GPT, write me a\nthousand word summary of the history of the Ottoman empire in Turkish. And of course, immediately I got that. So now I can study that on LingQ, I\nimported it and study it on LingQ. And then I said, write me a thousand\nword summary of the history of Turkey. Okay. Since the year 1900. And of course I got that right away. So if I want to get something on, the\ngolden age of philosophy in central Asia of a thousand years ago in\nTurkish, or even in Farsi, I haven't tried it, but maybe I can get something\nlike that and you can try the same. Get chat GPT to create. Summaries of books or summaries of periods\nof history within a thousand words or so. It seems to stop at about 750. So if you say 2000 words, I\ndon't think it'll go that far. Maybe I'm wrong. You can try it, but it enables me to\nget into areas of interest to me in the language that I'm learning and study\nthem on LingQ and acquire the vocabulary. It's working so well that I decided\nthat I should get into literature. I became an annual member, a year\nmember of a Turkish audiobook ebook website called Story Tell. And on my iPhone I have audiobooks\nwritten by Elif Shaak and so I can listen to them on my iPhone and not\nunderstand them very well or at all. Bits and pieces. So I said, but I also wanna buy the book,\nlike I wanna buy the book, have an itch. Because because I like reading\nin my bed before I fall asleep. But of course I can't\nunderstand it very well. So then my teacher was\nable to find me an e book. So I was able to import\nthe e book into LingQ. So now I can do the book in LingQ and\nacquire some of the words so that when I read it over here I might understand more. But then I went to chat GPT. And I said, please give me a\nthousand word summary of this book in Turkish, which ChatGPT did. The summary was excellent. The main characters, the main theme,\nlots of different things that give me a better sense of what's in the book. And the book is 300 some pages long. I now have a summary of it. And between that summary and\nthen going through the ebook on LingQ, eventually I'll get to\nwhere I will enjoyably be reading. The book itself. So just some thoughts\nand I'm more about input. I'm not interested in talking to a robot. I very much enjoy talking to\nmy Turkish tutor and I have two tutors now, twice a week each. So that's four sessions. I enjoy speaking with them. One tutor in particular is very good. He grabs the structures\nwhere I have trouble. I think he uses chat GPT\nto generate examples. Then he sends me a report with\nlots of examples of the structures where I struggled, but I enjoy that\ninteraction, that human interaction. The hour goes by very quickly. I can't see myself doing that\nwith a robot, but that's just me. Some people may want to use chat\nGPT in order to talk to their iPhone and have some practice in speaking. But personally, I prefer to build\nup my familiarity with the language, my vocabulary, my ability then to\nrecall words and structures that have become a part of me and try to\nuse them in genuine conversation. Just thought I'd share with you\nthen some of the ways that I'm using ChatGPT to improve in my Turkish. And I do think I am improving. So thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "The entrepreneur\u2019s guide to learning languages",
        "transcript": "Today's subject is business\nand language learning. Throughout my life, I have been\ninvolved with business and I've been involved with language learning. And I want to talk about how those\ntwo activities compare what you need for success in business, what you\nneed for success in language learning. I did a video on the subject a while\nago, and I talked about entrepreneurship. And of course the word entrepreneurship\ncomes from the French word entreprendre, to undertake. And of course to start a new language is. To take on a major undertaking. So is starting a new business. In my life, I have started two businesses. One in the wood business, which I\nstill have, that goes back to 1987. And then of course, LingQ, which I\nstarted with my son about 20 years ago. So how are they similar? How are they different? First of all, quite obviously\nto be successful in business or in language learning, you need\na high degree of commitment. You need a degree of passion. Passion, because it's not always easy. So to stay the course, you need to have\nthat burning desire to do something. One of the reasons why in Canada,\nthe level of bilingualism outside Quebec is so low is that despite the\nliterally billions of dollars that the Canadian government spends, if people\naren't motivated to learn French, they're not going to learn French. So learning a language. Starts with motivation. Similarly, if your approach to business is\none of get rich quick and you don't have a passion for the actual nuts and bolts of\nthe business you want to get into, if you are a shoemaker and you don't like making\nshoes, you probably won't be successful. So that's common to both. But there are some obvious\ndifferences right from the beginning. When you start a new language, in\na way you're starting from zero. If it's a new language, in many cases,\nyou know nothing about that language. The recent languages that I started,\nwhich are very different from languages that I knew previously, like\nPersian, like Arabic, like Turkish, it's almost like starting from zero. There's a very small number of loan words. In business, on the other hand,\nif you don't have Some market knowledge, some product knowledge. If you don't know some people who can\nhelp you, if you're like basically starting from zero, let's say you've\ngot a very steep uphill climb. So to that extent in business, that\nprior knowledge is very important. Now you can argue that in language\nlearning, if you're dealing with some input and it's on a subject that\nyou're familiar with, or it's a subject that you have some prior knowledge\nabout, you're going to do better. So prior knowledge is always helpful,\nbut prior knowledge is not a condition for success in language learning. Whereas I think in business,\nit is almost a condition. And when I started my wood\nbusiness, I had been working for the Canadian embassy in Tokyo. I had been involved with\nthe forest industry sector. I knew people. People, I knew products, I had\ninformation about the market. There was still a lot that I learned\nalong the way, but nevertheless, I didn't have that knowledge. And of course I worked for, let's\nsee, what was six years in Japan and a longer time back here in Vancouver with\nmajor Canadian exporting companies. So I had a lot of prior knowledge about\nthe wood business in Japan specifically before I started my own company. Now, another thing that's\ndifferent is language learning to me is like atomic habits. It's step by step, you slowly get better. Very often you're not aware of the\nfact that you're getting better. You just have to trust the process,\ncontinue to do whatever you're doing, particularly listening and reading, I\nbelieve in input, and you will gradually improve, even if you don't have the\nimpression that you're improving. If you stay with it, you're\nnot going to get worse. You can only get better. That's not the case in business. Business is much more volatile. You can have some good luck, a good\nperiod, big demand for the product that you're selling, for example, and\nthen you can run into some bad luck. A customer defaults on his payment or\nmarket prices go down, or you don't get the big deal you're hoping to get. So there's far more volatility in business\nand it does make it more challenging, but there are moments of tremendous\nsuccess, almost unexpected success. Which don't happen so much in\nlanguage learning, where we kind of plot along and keep our nose\nto the grindstone, so to speak. Another thing I find language\nlearning is very much personal. You learn for your own reasons, unless\nyou have to learn for some other purpose, which for me was the case when\nI was a Canadian government language student and I had to learn Mandarin\nChinese and I had to pass the British Foreign Service exam in Mandarin. Or when I was a student in France, I had\nto reach a certain level in my French. But for the rest of the time that\nI've been learning on my own, I learned for my own reasons. I learned in ways. that I like. I don't worry about the mistakes I make. I'm just learning for myself. And it's a solitary journey\nand I can do it on my own. I can have a teacher if I want,\nbut I don't need a teacher. In business, that's not the case. In business, you very\nmuch rely on other people. You rely on contacts. You rely on suppliers. You rely on customers. Relationships are so\nimportant in business. You, Don't want to burn any bridges. You have to invest in relationships so\nthat at a much later date, you can go back there and perhaps reap the benefits\nof having provided a service to people who are going to be helpful to you. So business is much more dependent\non interpersonal relationships, whereas languages, not so much. Of course, it's nice\nto have a good teacher. And I've had some excellent teachers who\nhave influenced me in French, in Mandarin. Even now, I have an\nexcellent tutor for Turkish. I had an excellent Tutor for Persian. So people can be important, but\nthey are not as important as is the case in business where\nthey are absolutely essential. So from that, if you're trying to learn\na language, you can quit when you want. You can be studying a certain bit\nof content or you're reading a book and you don't like the book. Can you just chuck the book? You don't have to continue. Whatever you do, you can stop at any time. You can say, I don't like this language. I'm not going to study\nthis language anymore. Or I'm now more interested\nin another language. So therefore, while I still like\nthat language, I might go back to it. But now I'm going to\ndo this other language. So you're entirely on your own. You're a vagabond. Not so in business. If you undertake to do\nsomething, you have to deliver. If you promise something and you\ndon't deliver, your name will be mud. As they say, and in business, it takes\na long time to build up a reputation. It's easy to ruin your\nreputation and your credibility. And similarly, language\nlearning is personal. I can make mistakes. Somebody might criticize me for mistakes. I don't care. Those are my mistakes. In business, your mistakes\nare not just your mistakes. Your mistakes can cost your company,\ncan cost your employees, can cost your your customer or your supplier or\nwhatever the nature of your business is. Maybe you have to be much, much\nmore careful not to make mistakes, and it's much more costly to\nrecover from mistakes in business. However, there is a lot of similarity. And I think that in the end, the biggest\nsimilarity is you have to stay with it. I've learned that in business,\nwhere starting two businesses, I went through long periods\nwhere it was very unprofitable. I had very little, if\nany, money coming in. I had only expenses, but I stuck\nwith it because I believed in it. I had that commitment, that passion,\nI'm going to stay with this thing. And it's a good thing in\nboth cases that I persevered. Because even though there were lots of\ndifficulties, some difficulties that I didn't even anticipate, and maybe if I had\nanticipated those difficulties, I would not have undertaken to do what I did. But in the end, it turned out successful. So languages are not quite like that. You can stay with it and not feel\nthat you're making any progress, but you're not going to lose anything. It's not like I'm investing a lot\nof money into a particular language so that if I never get anywhere,\nI'll have lost all of that money. As is the case in business, if you\nspend two, three, four years without making any money, that's expensive. That's coming out of your savings. It's coming out of somewhere. But in language learning,\nthat's not the case. You're just spending your time. And The point is in language learning,\nhowever much time you put in and whatever level you get to, it's all benefit. It's all rewarding. So even languages that I have left\nand would struggle to speak today, I derived so much pleasure from getting\nto that level in the language, and I know I can go back there, those\nlanguages aren't going anywhere. There's still a part of me and I will\nquickly be able to refresh and get back to the level where I was and improve on that. In business, it's not the same. If you spend three, four years and\neventually get to a level where you feel you cannot sustain your activity,\nthere's just a not enough investment capital available, you can't stay the\ncourse, you're going to have to drop it. Everything you've invested\nis to some extent lost. Now you have gained a lot of experience\nand there's a lot of people who have, gone bankrupt two or three times. lost a lot of money, but with\neverything that they have learned and the experience that they have gained,\nthen when they go and start another venture, they're able to succeed. So I think in both cases, if we look at\nthe beginning and the end, you have to have passion, commit the time and effort. And at the other end of it, you have to\nstay the course, you have to persevere. And if you do those two things, I\nthink you have a high probability of success, both in language learning. I would say in language learning for sure. And in business, More likely\nthan not, but the big thing in business is you're relying on luck. Language learning is not about luck. Language learning is about putting\nin the time and persevering only. But business, there's a major\nelement of luck and opportunity. So I just thought I would compare\nthose two and leave you with the video that I did on a similar\nsubject, entrepreneurship and language learning quite a few years ago. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "Why extensive reading is so effective for language learning",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about extensive\nreading, also known as free, voluntary reading, because I think reading\nis such a powerful way to improve your language skills, regardless\nof where you are in the language. I'm going to refer you to a\ndocument that was shown to me from Cambridge University, And also\nanother one from Oxford University. Before getting into the subject, it's\ninteresting to note, because I got curious doing research for this video,\nthe market for language learning worldwide in 2023 was over 60 billion U. S. dollars, and it's projected to reach\n115 billion dollars in the year 2032. So it's an enormous market. Apparently, two thirds of that\nmarket, Is for learning English now, given that it's not expensive to\nbuy a book, we can buy books online. There's an, a limitless amount of\nmaterial available online that we can read, that we can access, that\nwe can read and look up words. It is amazing that so much money is\nspent on the language learning industry, on things, for example, like LingQ. Reading is powerful, but maybe people\nare discouraged from reading or don't think they can do it on their own, or\nthey feel they need to have a teacher to guide them or a system to guide them,\nbut in fact, a lot can be achieved. by a motivated learner\nwho is willing to read. But there are issues and problems,\nand I want to get into those. First of all, if you refer to the link\nI left, you will see what extensive reading or free voluntary reading is. It's basically just reading, but\nit's reading material that's of interest, that's not too difficult,\nreading on your own, reading at a good speed, reading silently. I would add, although they don't\nmention it, it's probably a good idea to also have the audio for\nthe material that you are reading. Now, you'll see in this link that the\nCambridge study points out certain obvious benefits to extensive reading. Should be obvious, but may not be\nobvious to every language learner. And that is that reading improves\nour ability to read, obviously. It improves our vocabulary. We encounter words. We encounter words in\ncontext with other words. We get to see how they\nwork with other words. We get a better sense of grammar. It's a massive exposure to the language. It's easy to do. You do it on your own. When I was learning Chinese in\nHong Kong, over 50 years ago, my major activity was reading. And I would scour the bookstores of Hong\nKong to find readers with vocabulary lists behind each chapter, which I would review\nbefore reading and then after reading. There wasn't so much audio\navailable in those days. Reading is powerful. I also consider that, especially\nif you listen to the same material that you're reading, it upsets you. Almost like speaking because when you\nare reading on your own in a foreign language, you are sub vocalizing. So therefore it helps you to\nget to where you can speak. It helps you with your comprehension,\ngrasp of grammar, seeing words in context. All of these things are greatly,\nassisted by free voluntary reading. Now the Cambridge study refers\nto what they call obstacles. To free voluntary reading or extensive\nreading and most of those obstacles seem to refer to the resistance from teachers\nwho are Reluctant to see the learners go off on their own ahead of what the teacher\nwants to teach or that the classroom You know student will spend his or her time\nreading rather than Studying grammar or doing the other things the activities\nthat the teacher wants to do in other words The teacher is reluctant to give up\ntheir time Teacher time, classroom time to free voluntary reading, although it\nhas been demonstrated that free voluntary reading has all of these benefits. So the resistance on the part of some\nteachers is considered the main obstacle, but I don't see that as the main obstacle. To me, the biggest problem or the\nbiggest obstacle when it comes to free voluntary reading is vocabulary. Some of the proponents of free voluntary\nreading or extensive reading suggest that free voluntary reading should be based\non no more than four words per page of unknown words or a couple of percent\nunknown words for it to be a pleasant experience and that the student should\nbe encouraged to guess or infer the meaning of words that they don't know. To me, that's wrong. Actually, I shouldn't say it's wrong,\nbut I should say that the strategy when it comes to free voluntary\nreading depends on who you are and where you are in the language. Obviously, if you're a school child\nand you've got 10, 12 years or more to improve your vocabulary and to develop\nthat sense of joy of reading, then free voluntary reading with a very small\nnumber of unknown words is a good thing. Again, I would avoid the sort of. Teaching reading strategies, inferring\nstrategies, just let the child read, let the words they don't understand go by. They'll eventually figure\nthem out one way or another. So that's free voluntary reading\nin the sense that Krashen describes it for people in school, probably a\nbetter use of the student's time than listening to the teacher in many cases. However, when we as adults, and I include\nsay students at a university, say at a foreign university where they're\nhaving to take courses in a foreign language, adults wanting to learn a\nlanguage, we are in a bigger hurry. We don't have. 12 years to gradually, slowly\nincrease our vocabulary. We need to increase our\nvocabulary more quickly. And therefore the strategy\nhas to be different. We can't be dealing with\njust 2 percent unknown words. When we start in the language,\nof course, we have no known words or depending on how different the\nlanguage is to a language we know. So typically my strategy is I go to\nthe many stories and, or you go to other easy content, lots of repetition. So we are able to knock off the 500,\nmost common words of the language. We all know that. Frequency declines very quickly. And now we have to deal with chasing\nthose low frequency words that are very important and yet don't appear that often. So then in my experience, we need to deal\nwith a larger number of unknown words. Either we say using LingQ, we look\nthem up and we hope to acquire these words by seeing them often\nenough, or we just let them go. You can have free voluntary reading with a\nbook where there's a lot of unknown words. I never bother inferring or guessing. I, it just flows by me. But there is some benefit in\nencountering those words in this free voluntary reading format. However, it's frustrating if you\nforever don't know what the words mean. And that's essentially. What's at the origin of link typically\nearly on when I'm starting in a language, it might have 30 percent unknown words. And I admit that's difficult. And we track these statistics at link. And of course, initially you may\nknow a bunch of words that the system doesn't yet know that, So that might\nalso push the number up to 50%. If I were to go into Dutch, for\nexample, it'll show me a large percentage of words that I don't know. And in fact, in the case of Dutch, I\ncan infer the meaning of those words. But in Turkish, that's not the case. Very difficult for me to infer the\nmeaning of words unless they're connected to words that I already know. So in terms of the percentage\nthat I can deal with. 15%, 15 to 20 percent is an acceptable\nlevel of unknown words for me. And so I develop a strategy which\nsays at an early stage, I want material that's five minutes long. I want maybe 15 to 20\npercent unknown words. I want that to be about 20\nwords that I'm trying to learn. 2025 words that I've never seen before. And that is my strategy and\nit's an optimum position. It's a sweet spot in terms of increasing\nmy vocabulary so that I can eventually reach the stage where I can read a paper\nbook because I will have enough vocabulary so that I won't be guessing at every\nsecond or third word, but at the same time, it won't be, only three, four words\nper page that are unknown to me because then I'm not increasing my vocabulary. Make no mistake. We need a lot of vocabulary. Even low frequency vocabulary in\norder to enjoy free voluntary reading. So we have to invest that time in\ngetting our vocabulary level up. But while we are doing that, we are\nincreasing our familiarity with the language again, the research has shown\nthat people who read a lot, they write better, they have better grammar. They speak better. There's tremendous benefits to\nthis free voluntary reading, but you have to be prepared for it. You have to build yourself\nup to be able to do it. If you try to do that from day one,\nI think it'll be quite difficult. One other strategy I have is\nto stay in a limited range, a limited content area for a while. So that if I'm doing history of\nsay in this case, the Ottoman Empire, I will stay with that. So the same vocabulary will repeat. I have found that typically\nfiction is much more difficult. There's a far broader range of words and\ngiven the tremendous Precipitous decline of frequency of words in any language. You want to, have a strategy where you\nhave a greater likelihood of meeting the same words or related words again. So to summarize, many people like video. I'm not a big fan. I like video. I like film, but for language\nlearning, video is less effective. There's a lot of dead time. Sometimes it's difficult to\ncatch what people are saying. Whereas reading is pure words. And to that extent,\nlistening is pure words. So that if we're talking not just\nabout what's enjoyable, but how do we improve our vocabulary, how do we\nimprove our grasp of the language, reading and it's associated activity of\nlistening to my mind are the way to go. And yes, you want to consume more and\nmore of the language, more and more extensive, more and more free, voluntary. And above all, you don't. want to have too much\nteacher intervention. Teachers love to have pre reading\nquestions and post reading questions and comprehension questions and instructing\nyou on how to infer and critical thinking. I always quote Ruben Alves who\nsays, nothing destroys the enjoyment of reading as much as being asked\nquestions about what you have read. I may not understand it perfectly,\nbut it's what I understood. I'm happy with that. I don't want to be challenged. I just want to enjoy my reading. The essence of free voluntary reading is\nto be free of those kinds of impositions from the teacher and free to explore the\nlanguage following a strategy where you're gradually increasing your ability to take\non more and more difficult, potentially more and more interesting material, longer\nmaterial, and that way you will eventually achieve your language learning goal. So with that, I wanted to leave you\nthose references to people talking about free voluntary reading and lend\nmy support to free voluntary reading. One of Crouch's big\nbugbears, extensive reading. As a relatively inexpensive and\neffective way to improve your language skills in any language."

        "title": "What progress actually looks like in language learning",
        "transcript": "The element of surprise in language\nlearning, when I have a session with my tutor now in Turkish, I never\nquite know how I'm going to do. Sometimes I surprise myself, with\nhow well I do and yet at other times I'm very disappointed and I'm\nsurprised at how much I can't produce or I've forgotten or that I get the\nstructures of the language wrong. So there's always that element\nof anticipation, but surprise is a big part of language learning. We know that from the\nMRI imaging of the brain. the brain, based on the accumulated\nexperience of reading and listening to the language, the brain starts to\npredict both in terms of vocabulary and in terms of structure, what's coming. And it's an important part of our ability\nto understand the language, comprehend the language that we are able to predict. Language learning is coming. It has been called a probabilistic\nerror driven process, so that either what happens as we predict what's\ngoing to happen, it confirms what we think of the language, which is\ngood, strengthens our hold on the language, or it contradicts it. And if we see that different response\nthan we anticipated after a while, we adjust our sense of the language\nto match what actually is happening. So surprise is a big part of it. Similarly, even when we go to\nspeak, we have to reach into what we have accumulated, our sense of\nthe language, and we have to grab. Some words and some\nphrases and try them out. And depending on the response we get,\nagain, that's going to confirm or not confirm, encourage us to adjust our\ncomprehension, our sense of the language. So surprise is always there. So it's a bit like this joke,\nand I can't remember if it was a German officer or what. Nationality of officer. You can pick the\nnationality of your choice. But the story went that this\nofficer laughed three times every time he was told a joke. So he laughed when he was told\nthe joke, he laughed later when the joke was explained to him. And then three weeks later,\nwhen he finally understood the joke, he laughed again. So it's a bit silly, but there's\na lot to that because first of all, jokes are about surprise. So we find something funny\nbecause something happens that is contrary to our expectation. And this expectation or being\ncontrary to the expectation is very much culture dependent. It's context dependent, so you have to\nhave a familiarity with that culture or that context in order for whatever happens\nin the joke to appear funny to you. And until that happens,\nyou can have it explained. And this is true, I find,\nin language learning. I notice, for example, with my\nTurkish tutor, I have read the explanation of the Turkish verbs. I have looked at the tables, and\nwhen I go to use it, I get it wrong. Until it clicks, so we have to be patient. We won't notice it, we\nwon't be able to produce it. Even though we've read the tables and\nwe had it explained, and yet, somehow, until that context is rich enough,\nthat what we are predicting, in the way of a structure or vocabulary item,\nIt's either confirmed or, adjusted. Until we have that, we\nwon't find the joke funny. We won't, be able to use\nthe language correctly. And so we need to be patient\nand we need to circle back. I've looked at the tables\nover and over again. That didn't do it. I've read, I've listened to texts and\nfinally it starts to come into focus and we just have to wait for that. Now, some people say, Oh, Steve,\nlike for example, in Turkish, now I'm at 20, 000 known words. I say what does that really mean? You don't really know those words. You can't use those words. However, those are words that in a\ngiven context, I understood and was confident enough that I understood\nthem, that I threw them into my known words reserve in my brain. And there's many more that are\nnot yet known that also sit in my reserve, but they're all part of\nmy growing sense of the language. So thank you. To me, in order to build up my ability\nto predict, I need to accumulate words. The fact that I encourage myself by\nclaiming some of these words as known in some sense that, okay, in a given\ncontext, I understood that sort of scope of meaning, maybe in another context,\nI won't understand it, but I will. It doesn't matter. It's an ongoing process of\ngetting used to the language. So I don't worry about\nhow well I know the word. Some people say you have\nto be able to use it. You have to invest time in studying\nthe etymology and, or you should use a, monolingual dictionary and all\nof this sort of focusing in on that word, I think is the wrong approach. You have to throw it in there, claim\ncredit for some that you're, you think you know, and you may be surprised to\nfind out you don't know it, but you just keep on filling your head with\nwords and then seeing what you predict when you hear the language, when you\nread the language, when you speak the language, and you slowly adjust. And eventually you get to the\nstage where you understand the joke, or you understand the movie. Because even there, when you are\nwatching a movie, say I'll be watching a movie in Turkish, I'll It's not\njust the words, it's my sense of that cultural context, which gradually grows. And in that sense, there are fewer\nand fewer surprises as we get better and better at the language. And therefore we shouldn't\nbe too hard on ourselves. If we continue to disappoint\nourselves in conversation or continue not to understand certain things,\nunpleasant surprises, that's normal. But there also are lots of pleasant\nsurprises when we do better. Then we thought we were gonna do. So just a little digression on this whole\nissue of, the importance of the known words total, that I consider an important\npart of my language learning strategy and my goal setting what that actually means. And this reference to what we know\nfrom how the brain learns languages, that the element of surprise is a\nbig part of how the brain gradually gets used to a new language. Thank you for listening. Bye."

        "title": "Do I really know 20 languages?",
        "transcript": "So when can you say, you know, a\nlanguage I say, I know 20 languages. What does that really mean? I often get criticized because I'm\nobviously much better than some languages than other languages. I was thinking about this because\nI had a conversation just a couple of hours ago with my Turkish tutor. And actually I didn't\ndo too badly in Turkish. We discussed Turkish history. We discussed, uh, you know, the\nsituation in Turkey, the economy, quite a variety of subjects. Of course I made a lot of mistakes, but\nI noticed that I'm getting better every time I speak because I'm putting so much\neffort into my listening and reading. I'm getting a better sense of the\ngrammar, things that I didn't notice the first time I noticed them now. So then I thought to myself, you\nknow, at the present moment, if I look at my 20 languages, Turkey,\nHe's already in the second group just because I've been refreshing\nit for the last six, seven weeks. So if I look at my 20 languages,\nI would divide them into three groups in terms of my level. The first group, first seven languages\nwould be English, French, Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, Swedish, German. Those are languages that\nI feel comfortable with. Quite comfortable speaking. I may make mistakes, but\nI have a large vocabulary. My accent isn't too bad. I manage. Call it either just something less\nthan or something more than B2. The second group of languages are\nlanguages where I can communicate. Uh, I can understand, uh, movies. To a large extent, not perfectly. And these are Italian, Portuguese,\nCantonese, Russian, Ukrainian. And I would add in now\nPersian and Turkish. Even though those are two languages\nthat I've been going at recently, I have conversations with my\ntutors in both Persian and Turkish. So I am better at those languages. So maybe I'm a B1 in some of\nthem getting closer to B2. Certainly I have a large passive\nvocabulary in all of those languages. It only, I think what's missing is\nthat I have to speak them more often in order to be able to speak them better. But I can read, I can listen to,\nuh, you know, radio programs. And with the help of LingQ, I can work\nmy way through what they're saying. So it's not a completely\nforeign language to me. Then the third group are\nlanguages that I had that sort of B1 type level at some point. I have a large passive vocabulary, but\nI could not try to speak it now, but I could very quickly revive them, believe. And these are Korean,\nGreek, Romanian, Italian. Czech, Polish, Arabic. So I'm talking tens of thousands of\nwords that I know and ability to read. I can read, you know, Twitter\nfeeds in Czech, no problem. But if I had to try to speak, it would\ntake me, whether it's two days or three or five, something along those lines. When I was in Korea and I was able\nto get into conversations with people over at the dinner table, it was fine. So, those are, I would\nalmost call them dormant. So, they right now are something less\nthan B1, but in terms of potential are in that between B1 and B2 range. So, can I say that I know 20 languages? When we know people, we don't know\neverything about people that we know. We know some. Well, we know some. Less well, we have gotten to know people. And I think it's in that sense that\nwhen I say I know 20 languages, I know something of 20 languages. In fact, I know quite a bit because\nI understand how the structure of the language works, even though\nI can't produce it correctly. All the time, some of the\ntime, most of the time, I have a large passive vocabulary. It's not like I know nothing about them. My vocabulary level in all of those\nlanguages is close to B2 because I have a major emphasis on comprehension\nand, Vocabulary rather than speaking. I'm not drilling myself\nin simple conversation. So to that extent, I can\nsay I know 20 languages. And it all reminds me of the video\nthat I once did called learning a language is like falling in love. And it's true. And I will leave you a link to\nthat article, which was on my blog. And it basically says that to\ndo well in learning a language. You have to fall in love with the\nlanguage while you're learning it. Ideally, you focus on the one language. And that was my mistake with doing\nthree languages, Persian, Arabic, and Turkish at the same time. Right now I'm focused on Turkish. I love my Turkish. It's like when you are in love, you're\nobsessed with the object of your love and all of their, you know, features and\ncharacteristics and behavior patterns. And even if there are some\nbehavior patterns that irk you, that doesn't bother you. You're not judgmental about the\nsort of object of your love. By the same token, as\nI said in the article. The language doesn't judge you,\nso it's a very easy relationship. You just love the language. You want to imitate the language,\nwhich in a sense is the highest form of loving something is that you want\nto be like the object of your love. And, uh, you know, you can then move,\nlike I can have an affair with Turkish right now, I can move on and I've still\ngot my other girlfriend, which is. Persian or Arabic waiting in the wings. And I might get interested in\nanother language at some point. And all of that is fine, but I\ncan't possibly maintain them all. I don't have enough time in the\nday to be speaking to people in all of these different languages. Now, obviously the more opportunity\nI've had to speak these languages, the better I speak them. And many of these languages I learned\nbefore LingQ and had plenty of opportunity, whether hitchhiking in\nSpain or traveling in Germany while I'm business there to speak those languages. However, with those languages that\nare in my first group and particularly languages that are in the second and third\ngroup, you can see from my statistics at LingQ that I have a very large, Passive\nvocabulary, and even languages like German or Spanish or Swedish, or even Danish,\nwhich I didn't even include, not to mention Ukrainian, Czech, Polish, Korean,\nover 90, 000 known words in Russian. The passive vocabulary is there. And even if through lack of opportunity\nto use them, I have trouble speaking them. I consider, I know them, I have\ngotten to know them, I know them, and I can go back to them. And I think it's important that\nwe recognize that all of us learn languages for different reasons. We learn them to different\ndegrees of proficiency. For some of us, it's very important\nto be able to speak well, even with a limited vocabulary, because we\nlive surrounded by the language. We have to communicate. In my case, for example, with my\nTurkish, I focus in on input to improve my comprehension, and now\nI'm starting to speak more and more so that by the time I go to Turkey,\nI will be able to communicate. So, because Turkey is now the most\nrecent object of my affection, let me see if I can say some things in Turkish. Alright, there you have it. Basically I said that, uh, you\nknow, I had a chat with my tea teacher a little while earlier. We talked about a variety of subjects\nincluding history and in fact, we talked about a great deal of things. I manage quite well, but\nI made a lot of mistakes. Turkish uh, verbs are quite difficult,\nbut as I improve and if I improve, I will do a longer video in Turkish\nwith subtitle, subtitles, so you can judge how well I have engaged with the\nlatest, uh, object of my affection. Uh, thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "Chunking: the secret to fluency?",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about\nlearning languages in chunks. I'm sure it's a concept that\nmany of you are aware of. I'm going to tell you why I think\nit's important and how we go about learning languages in chunks. Quite a while ago, maybe 25, 30 years\nago, where up until that point, people tended to think that language learning\nwas all about words and grammar. So if you have all these words\nand you learn the formula. Then you'll be able to use the\nwords correctly according to sort of standard usage for that language. Then a professor Lewis came along and\nsuggested that, in fact, no, as much as 60 percent of any language, it consists\nof these sort of formulaic or formula based chunks, words that belong together. In my view, it's not just the obvious\nsort of collocations, you know, by the way, or on the other hand. or expressions like that. Everything about the language\nconsists of words that normally are used together with other words. And I remember when I was correcting\nEnglish at LingQ, the biggest problem was not grammar per se, but that\npeople would choose the wrong word. Word choice, word usage. And that has all to do\nwith this idea of chunks. And so words are used\ntogether with other words. And those are chunks. So how do we learn the chunks? One person suggested back in 1925, a\ncertain Harold Palmer suggested that we should learn the most frequent\npatterns in the language and learn to use them, memorize them, come out with\nthese prefabricated chunks of language. This is kind of like\nthe phrasebook approach. Personally, I've found\nthat very difficult. I can't remember these. Prefabricated phrases. I mean, they'll come out naturally at some\npoint if I've kind of acquired them in some way naturally, but to deliberately\nlearn them has never worked for me. Now there's been a lot of research\nand I'm going to leave a link to a very good presentation on the\nsubject of chunking from Cambridge. And if you have the time, you can\ngo through it and you will see that one of the sort of proofs that. Chunking works that they refer to\nis that a group of students who went to France and had a lot of exposure\nto French, they ended up speaking in sort of natural sounding chunks. So they had acquired an ability\nto speak in chunks and that made them sound more natural and they\nwere able to speak more quickly. We can't all fly off to the country\nwhere the language is spoken that we are trying to learn. But as you'll see from this link that\nI left you, the teachers want to teach. So if chunks are important, then they\nwant to teach them, they want to have, you know, do we teach them for frequency? Do we teach them for ease of learning? They come up with different criteria\nso that they can deliberately teach the chunks that the learners should learn. Which, in my way of thinking,\nis kind of putting things backwards, as I shall explain. Now, of course, part of this desire\nto teach the chunks, or teach vocabulary, is that if you allow the\nlearner to simply learn from, you know, a lot of meaningful content,\nthey may shy away from deliberately learning the language, deliberately\nlearning the grammar, the rules. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. I'm a believer in crash, and I believe\nwholeheartedly in The power of input. So I avoid doing too much sort of\ndeliberate learning and more sort of getting the language in me more naturally. In fact, you'll see in that study that\nI sent you to that one commentator said that who was kind of pushing back\non the idea of learning chunks that yeah, we can acquire chunks from being\nexposed to a lot of different contexts. And in fact, there is research to show\nthat we learn Patterns and verbs more easily from a variety of contexts, as\nopposed to sort of frequency of exposure. There are more traditional, you\nknow, vocabulary learning techniques. We learn it better if we're exposed\nto a lot of different contexts. But this one person said, the sheer\nenormity of the amount of material that we have to, you know, consume in order\nto acquire our vocabulary and our text. Chunks from sort of input is\njust, it makes it impossible. But then I go back to these students who\nwere studying French, who went to France and came back with natural chunking. They didn't do it because they\ndeliberately studied chunks. They did it because they had a\nlot of exposure in meaningful contexts and speaking to people. They were interested in\nwhat they were hearing. They were picking up the language. They were trying it out and gradually\nthey spoke more and more naturally. Gradually. They used more natural chunks. So this brings me back\nto my Turkish learning. So this morning I had a lesson with my\nTurkish tutor, and of course I struggle mightily to produce, particularly\nthe verb forms, correctly in Turkish. And kind of I say to myself,\nwill I ever be able to do that? And, of course, I know from\nexperience that I will gradually be able to do that better and better\nas long as I trust the process. So I have a lot of words in my vocabulary\nthat I can trot out in our conversation connecting them with very poor grammar. And over time, I believe\nI will get better at it. So my strategy is massive. So, as I did with Polish, as I did\nwith Danish, as I did with other languages, I find a website which\nhas audiobooks and e books, which in the case of Turkish is Storytel. And the big advantage of getting on\nthese websites is that in addition to podcasts that you can subscribe to, you\ncan also, once you connect with audible. com, if you're learning\nEnglish or Spanish, or in my case, Storytel or publio. com. PL or, or Saxo, I think it was for Danish. It shows up on your Apple CarPlay screen. So the minute I get in the car,\nI just turn on an audio book that I'm listening to in Turkish. I'm listening to it. I am picking up chunks here and there. I don't understand actually what\nthey're talking about, but I do hear very clearly defined chunks that\nform part of the language that I, eventually want to be able to use. And so what I then do is, because I\nalways get the audiobook and the e book, then I go into the e book on LingQ,\nand in particular, as I'm reading it, where I see some really useful chunks,\nI can go into sentence mode, I can link some of these words together to\nform phrases, I can review them, and then I have to reassemble the sentence. And in this way, I get a sort of a\nrandom exposure to different chunks. Of course, it's not the tremendous number\nof chunks that I will eventually need, but slowly I'm going to be picking up\nand noticing and collecting more and more of these chunks through massive\nexposure to the language and the occasional effort at Sort of in isolating\nand focusing in on certain chunks. Based on my experience, I\nwill eventually get better. I won't be perfect and it takes\na long time to sort of reduce the number of mistakes we make. And that's why in, in one of these other\nlinks that I leave with you, where they compare, you know, frequency versus time. Diversity of context to\nhelp you learn vocabulary. They sort of say for early production. Why for early production? We don't need early production. We don't need to be able\nto speak right away. I've been at Turkish now\nfor five and a half months. I can't expect to speak that well. I don't have that sort of goal. I want to get the language in me. And I will gradually get better,\nand I can always go back to content that I've done before. Even easy content like the mini\nstories, I can go through it in sentence mode if necessary, focus in\non certain chunks, or patterns, or verb forms, and continue to improve. All the while enjoying my language\nlearning, and not being too focused in on deliberately learning anything. So, there you have it. I hope that was helpful. Thank you. Bye."

        "title": "How to learn a new language as an immigrant",
        "transcript": "Today, I want to talk about\nlearning languages as an immigrant. Now, to me, being an immigrant\nis the ideal environment in which to learn a language. You are surrounded by the language\nthat you would like to learn, that you in fact need to learn. So there are very clear reasons\nwhy you should be learning the language and you are surrounded by\neverything you need to be successful. The main sort of receiving countries for\nimmigrants are either English speaking, or they're German speaking, or maybe they're\nTurkish speaking, or in the case of Latin America, I think a lot of the immigrants\nare in fact people who speak the language of the country they're moving towards. But in any case, there are certain\nthings that are common to an immigrant needing to improve in the local language. First of all, it is\nusually very important. According to one survey in the U. S., Close to half of all immigrants\nfeel that they are held back by their poor language skills in terms\nof job opportunities, in terms of accessing services, in terms of\nmany things that they would like to do in order to function better. In their new country. So it is a serious problem in\nlooking at some German sites. It was the same people who have\ngood language skills do well on the job market and people who don't\nhave good language skills don't. So that's pretty obvious, but\nit is borne out by statistics. So it is important to do\nwell in your new language. Now, one of the things I think that\nis important as an immigrant is that when you arrive in the new country,\nthat's when you should put the maximum effort into learning the language. Now, I realize a lot of immigrants are\nalready there and struggle with the language, and I'll get to that later,\nbut if you are just arriving in a new country, that's when you need to totally\nfocus on getting as good as you can be. I took that attitude\nwhen I moved to Japan. First six months, I said, I'm going to\nbecome functional in Japanese because once I get functional in Japanese, then I can. Coast from there on, take\nadvantage of being in a country where everyone speaks Japanese. Sometimes you hear people say, well, first\nlittle while I want to get used to the country, uh, connect with a local, uh,\ncommunity of, of expats from my country. Not a good idea. There are various reasons for\nthis, but one of them is that there is this phenomenon, which\ndoesn't necessarily always apply. But which is based on a pattern where\nin an initial sort of six months or so, when we arrive in a new country,\neverything is new, different, exciting, unreal, like a dream. It's fun. That's when you want to start in on\nthe language because very often after those initial six or nine months,\nthere's a reaction that sets in. Where we miss the old country. We're annoyed by some\naspects of the local culture. And so we're less motivated to learn. And this apparently can go on\nfor a year or for 18 months. And after that, we sort of settled into\na period where we accept life in the new country just is, that's the way it is. It's neither exciting\nnor does it annoy us. It's just is. And, uh, that's how we live. So. The danger is that if you don't make that\nspecial effort in the first six months to take advantage of the excitement of\nbeing in a new country, you might be then turned off learning the language\nbecause of the negative things or the things you miss about your old country. And then you settle into a pattern where\nyou are living perhaps with community of expats of people who speak your language\nand you're no longer making that effort to improve because make no mistake,\nit takes a lot of consistent effort to improve in the language to get to a level. where you are not amongst the 50%,\nfor example, in the United States of immigrants who feel that they are held\nback by inadequate language skills. So what if you're already in the country? You're no longer in the situation of\nhaving just arrived or you can take advantage of that initial period\nof enthusiasm that I talked about. What do you do then? Well, my advice is start again,\nrestart, refresh, try to generate some enthusiasm, much like I do at\nLingQ when I have like a 30 minute 30 day challenge or a 90 day challenge. Right now I've challenged myself to\nlearn 300 new words a day in Turkish. And I'm doing it. I'm maintaining that level. I started with 8, 000 words and I'm\nnow at 16, 000 words after six weeks. And I hope to get over 30,\n000 words of Turkish before my wife and I travel to Turkey. Challenge yourself and you\nwill get to another level. In that language. Don't accept that you're forever\ngoing to be in that group of people who, you know, suffer from facing\nlanguage obstacles in the new country. I am also an immigrant. I emigrated with my family in\n1951 from Sweden, and you can see me here in Sweden and then on\nthe boat, and now I'm in Canada. And I have no recollection as a\nfive year old of transitioning from Swedish to English. And I promptly forgot my Swedish,\nalthough I've relearned it subsequently. And my parents, of course, they lived\nin Canada with their accent, with their less than native like accent. English language skills, but\nthey also spoke French and other languages and they did just fine. So it's obviously easy for the\nchild to quickly sound like a local. And the sort of adult immigrant is\nalways going to be feeling inadequate in their language skills, but\nthey can be at a level where that needn't be an obstacle for them. And it wasn't an obstacle for my parents. Link has always had a connection with. Immigrants. I was very interested in\nthe situation of immigrants. Back when we started LingQ,\nI was learning Cantonese. I heard about an immigrant who had\nhis money stolen at the airport. We hired him because\nwe were doing IT work. He was an IT person. We thought, at the very least,\nwe'll help him out for a few months. And then a If it turns out that\nhe's a good employee, well, then we've found a good employee. And, uh, in the end he went back\nto China, but we developed LingQ. And we realized at that point that\nall the TOEFL scores and other scores are relatively meaningless. He had high scores in TOEFL, but\nhe couldn't really understand what people were saying. He couldn't really\ncommunicate effectively. He wasn't connecting. Now, in terms of how\nto learn, essentially. It doesn't change. It's the same three keys. You have to have a positive attitude,\nyou have to put in the time, and you have to develop that ability to notice\nwhat's happening in the language. So even when I was in Japan, surrounded\nby the Japanese language, I had to put effort into making sure I could take\nadvantage of being in that environment. So, Lots of listening, lots of reading. I was always listening in my car. I was always reading. And of course nowadays, you can access so\nmany more resources than I had in Japan. There's YouTube, there's all kinds\nof podcasts, there's all kinds of resources available online. Like here I am, I'm learning Turkish\nnow, in Vancouver, and I went to an e-book, audiobook website, worked\nmy way through their Turkish. Signed up, created an account and\nbought myself an e-book audio book. So it's matching e-book audio book, okay? I don't know how long it's going to\ntake me to get through that book. It'll take me a long time. It's not ideal because the audio of that\nwhole book is not going to match the e-text that I've imported into LingQ. In an ideal scenario, that book would be\nin five minute segments, all time stamped, where I can focus in on the vocabulary\nfrom each of those five minute segments. And we may one day at LingQ get to\nthe point We're using AI, we can break all imported content into five\nminute segments, or the user can determine whether he or she wants\nthree minute or eight minute segments and somehow tie the audio to it. We're not there yet, but I can go through\nthe book in LingQ, Saving Words and Phrases, and I can listen on my iPhone\nwhere I have this app from Storytel, Turkish source for audio and eBooks. It's just a small example, but\nsomeone who's in an English speaking environment has audible.com, has you know, unending resources,\npodcasts on every imaginable subject. And so there's so much more in the\nway of resources that the immigrant can use to improve because the\nfocus still has to be on getting the language in you, increasing your\ncomprehension level and vocabulary level. the language. All the good things that we talk\nabout on this channel and of course which are embodied in LingQ. Of course once you're in the country you\ncan watch TV, you can try to make friends, you can go to the community center, get\ninto activities where you have common interests with some of the local people. All of these things to push yourself\noutside of your comfort zone. Remember, don't worry about how\nyou sound and how you speak, we are never As good as we would like to be. Never. If you're waiting for that moment,\nwhen you're going to be so good that you can just confidently\nspeak, you'll never get there. You're always kind of not as good\nas you'd like to be, but never as bad as you think you are. We're better than we think we are,\nbut we're never quite as good as we would love to be in an ideal world. I also would caution people against\nbeing too reliant on sort of government sponsored ESL classes twice a week. That's not going to do it. I see so many immigrants who go to their ESL class twice or three times a week. It's a nice social situation. They make friends from their\nsame language background. It's comforting maybe, but it's not going\nto get them out of their comfort zone into being able to use English effectively. You have to do that on your own. That ESL classroom is not going to do it. You have to do the kinds of things\nthat I talk about doing in order to get to where you operate comfortably\nin the language again, so much of the sort of language teaching industry\nbuilds up complicated structures that in my mind are not very helpful. One of these is the Canadian Language\nBenchmarks System, which divides language levels into 12 levels defined so finely\nthat I can't tell the difference between level 4 or 5 And you can check the link\nthat I'll leave here and see if you can make sense of what that difference is. You cannot define the level that's\nrequired to be a bank teller or a checkout clerk in a supermarket or any other job. It's always Less than\nthat and more than that. You need an overall level in the language. You have to build up all your skills. By the same token, much of this emphasis\non business English and academic English, I'm very much against that. You have to improve your\nwhole level in the language, following things of interest. And this is another important thing. Find things you like in the new language. Find things you like in the new\ncommunity, activities or TV programs or books, and spend your time\nwith things that you enjoy doing. And you do have to be able to eventually\nread a book, because that's an indication of the level that you have achieved. I often hear people say, I have trouble\nspeaking, but I understand, or I can read. But most of those people\nwill never read a novel. You have to get to where\nyou can read a novel. As an immigrant, if you really want\nto not be in that lower 50 percent, you have to bring your whole level up. Another thing that comes up with\nimmigrants is this idea of not wanting to lose their heritage language. And statistics show that by the\nsecond or third generation, the children of immigrants, or the\nchildren of children of immigrants, speak the local language at home. And this is held out as such. Somehow a bad thing. I don't see it as a bad thing. I see it as a normal thing. That's what happens. That's what North American,\nfor example, society is. People integrate. If the third generation immigrant wants\nto learn the ancestral language, fine. But if that person doesn't speak the\nancestral language, that's also fine. I forgot my Swedish. Then I went after French. I was very keen on French for a while. Then I learned Mandarin and Japanese. All these other languages. And I eventually got back to Swedish. And even my parents who came from Czech\nand Slovakia, I got back to Czech. In other words, people will learn the\nlanguages that they want to learn. There shouldn't be some kind of an\nobligation to learn the ancestral language as if this is some sort of absolute good. Even here, I often hear Persian speakers\ntell me that I speak Persian better than a lot of young generation children\nof immigrants here in Vancouver. So be it. I think to put so much\nemphasis on maintaining the ancestral language is wrong. Nothing wrong with learning\nthe ancestral language. If that's what the learner\nis motivated to do. But if the learner is more\nmotivated to learn another language, go for that as well. And I always consider it a good\nthing when the immigrant family speaks English at home, because the\nchildren are going to do fine anyway. They will learn to speak English\nas well as all the other people. People surrounding them, but the parents\nare the ones that face difficulty with their poor language skills. And if they get in the habit of\nspeaking English at home, at least some of the time, I think that\nalso helps them and improves their prospects in the new society. So I hope that was helpful and, uh,\nlook forward to hearing your comments. Thank you. Bye."

        "title": "Reading or listening: what\u2019s the best way to learn?",
        "transcript": "What's better for learning,\nlistening or reading? I am currently reading a book about\nCentral Asia, which I started into because I got the audio book and\nthe audio book got me interested. And then I decided I wanted to\nbuy the book because when I lie in bed before going to sleep, I don't\nwant to be listening to something. I want to read something. There are many strategic reasons why\nreading is better than listening. Although listening is easier, but\nlet's go back to the beginning. Obviously throughout most of. The history of humankind, we didn't read. And even up until very\nrecently, only a very small percentage of people could read. So there's no special, you know,\nevolutionary device in our brains that enables us to read, it's amazing\nthat we're able to do this and we essentially, as I pointed out before,\nthe brain uses essentially the same sequence of sort of locations for\nreading as it does for listening. But of course, there are differences. When you hear a voice, you have an\nemotional connection to the voice. For that matter, if you're listening\nto a lecture and you see the professor, or if you're talking to someone,\nthat's also a different experience than simply listening to a recording. And there are people who say that we\nwill learn better if we face to face, talk to someone than if we just listen\nto a recording, all of which is true. However, it is a process of ingesting. Information or being entertained. And as you look into it, there are a\nnumber of people who have different positions on the respective advantages\nof listening and reading for students and so forth and so on, and I will leave\na few links here in the description box. But first let's look at this phenomenon. Uh, audiobooks, first of all, if you\nlook behind me, you can see two tall bookshelves for CDs, 10 shelves on\neach one or more full of audio CDs in Czech, in Russian, in Spanish,\nin French, in German, in Swedish. For the, you know, 20 odd years that\nI've been learning languages, whenever I'm in the country where there are\naudio CDs, I buy them typically, but not only fiction, but also nonfiction. And there's more. I mean, I got Chinese ones here. Kai you know, Shi. Wai Na Amir. This is a Czech version of War and Peace. Again, in, in, in Chinese,\nI have my Xiang Cha. I have to admit that I buy audio CDs. And books at a much faster\nrate than I can consume them. My appetite is larger than\nmy stomach, which is okay. Maybe one day I'll get to them, but\nI always feel if I'm in Riga, Latvia, and there are Russian bookstores\nand I can buy Russian language CDs that I can't get in Vancouver. I'm going to buy them and the\nglobal market for audiobooks has been growing very, very rapidly. There seem to be all kinds of statistics\nout there, but it's billions of dollars and it's growing and it's\ngrowing because we now have iPhones or Androids and we can actually do\nour listening on our telephones. And so much has made it\neasier to learn this way. And young people don't mind. Blurring this way. There's also been an explosion in eBooks,\nwhich again is in the billions of dollars. And that's all part of this\nexploding availability of information and entertainment of which\nYouTube, Netflix is also a part. And so now we have different\nways of accessing it. We can sync across different platforms. All of these things have changed. But what about the fundamental\nissue of is it better to read or is it better to listen? I referenced one study\nhere, which shows that. So much depends on what we\nwant to do and what kind of information we want to access. So for scientific information, apparently\nstudents that were allowed to read versus those that only listened, the\nones who read got 80 some percent accuracy in their answers and the\nstudents who only listened got 59%. And obviously when you are reading,\nyou have a different strategy. You can stay longer on a\nparticular section and you have trouble understanding,\nor you can, uh, skip to those. Sections that interest you. Whereas when you're listening,\nyou tend to just listen through. You tend not to flip back. You tend not to go forward. On the other hand, I can listen\nwhile doing chores around the house. I can listen in the car. The Chinese, uh, history CD I've shown\nyou, like drive a car and learn history. So there are different uses there. But I think that trying to say\nthat one is better than the other. He kind of misses the point to me. What matters is that they\nreinforce each other. The fact that I found an audio book\non the history of Central Asia, which I'm interested in because I'm\nlearning Turkish, then I'm listening to this and it, he goes on and\non and sometimes I think I would like to jump ahead to a different. Period in the history of Central\nAsia, I want the book and I want to be able to read it in my bed. So it drives me to get the book. The other thing is whenever we do, whether\nwe listen or read, we don't get all of it. And we certainly don't get\nall of it in the first pass. This is true in language learning. It's true in acquiring\nany other information. It's true even in terms of\ntrying to retain, based on my experience, fictional stories. And I have used fiction a lot. Di Promessi Sposi, I use for Italian. I listen to the audio book\nand then I read the book. I harvest the words that link,\nso I increase my vocabulary. And it's two different ways of\nconnecting with the same material. And we can go back several times. Maybe listening gives us A bit of a head\nstart, a bit of a sense of what's there. And then when we read, we pick up more. Or if we have read ahead a little\nbit, then when we listen to it, we understand a little bit more. So the two are reinforcing. I don't think it's an either or situation. If I'm studying for a science\nexam, even though my retention. Of science information won't be as good\nfrom just plain listening, but if I can find a podcast on that subject and\nI can listen to that while exercising or in public transit or driving, and\nthen I go back and read that same material, I will understand more. In fact, I always recommend covering the\nsame material from different sources. Even two different books,\nthree different books, audio material, it's all reinforcing. Even the eBooks, for example, Kindle\napparently has like 80 percent of the market for eBook readers. And I use Kindle on my iPad, but I\nprobably do more reading in LingQ. That's certainly, I do more reading\nin LingQ than I do in Kindle. And I'm not a struggling\nreader in English. But I am a struggling reader in just about\nevery other language that I'm learning, maybe with the exception of say French,\nthere are words that I don't know. There are sentences that I may know the\nwords, but it's not instant meaning, clear meaning the way English is for me. Now it could be that, uh, struggling\nreaders in English are in a similar situation and there I find that\nsometimes sentence mode, but not always sentence mode, looking up words, you\nknow, having the audio timestamp to what I'm reading, all of these things. And so the audio helps me read better. So there's all of this kind of\nmutual reinforcing going on. And I've often said, I think that in\nthe sort of literacy strategies, there's too much emphasis on decoding strategies\nand inferring strategies and pre reading strategies and comprehension questions. If people were allowed simply to listen\nand read, to combine those two wonderful ways of accessing information or fiction\nor anything else, it I think both improve. In fact, there is evidence\nthat people who read more also understand better when they listen. So the the two are very much connected. So I think we should be aware that\nthis explosion of material via the internet, both audio and text, and the\nincreasing variety of devices and the way the devices sync with each other,\ngives us a whole different approach to. Collecting information, learning, enjoying\nstories, and not to mention video. Like obviously if we're watching\na movie, if we're just listening to the movie, that's a whole\ndifferent sensation as compared to actually seeing the video itself. So combine text, video, audio,\ncombine it all as much as you can. Don't worry about what you forget,\nbecause you're probably going to forget. You're going to forget parts\nof the story you just read. You're going to forget words. You're going to forget stuff\nyou needed for your exam. But the more you go over and harvest\nthe same material, the same information using different approaches, the audio,\nthe listening, reading different books, all of this is gradually going to\nhelp you collect more and more of that information, as long as you recognize\nthat perfection is not a realistic goal. So those are my thoughts on audio versus\nreading, the importance of each in our learning processes and in our ability\nto enjoy information and entertainment. Thank you for listening."

        "title": "Stop obsessing over grammar: focus on this instead",
        "transcript": "What's more important, vocabulary,\nwords, or grammar, or the structure, the usage pattern of a language? As you know, I emphasize vocabulary as\nthe key measurement of our potential. And I showed you last time\nhow I add to my word total. In fact, I should point out, I am now\nat 15, 000 known words in Turkish. I've added 5, 500 new known words to my\nknown word total just in the past month. And why is this important? And I want to. Refer to some of the comments\nand criticisms that I received from that last video. I will also show you how I do this on\nmy iPhone, that is to say how I am able to focus in every day on pushing that\nknown word total to the level that I think I need in order to be able to\neventually do well in Turkey when I visit. So the first thing is, people\nsaid in Turkish there's so many different forms of the same word. Different forms of verbs. All of this is true, but some forms\nare easier to remember than others. If we take the case of Spanish, for\nexample, I find that the imperfect amaba is easier to remember than\nthe pure past tense, the preterite, which has different endings. To me, it's much more difficult\nbecause there is a natural order of learning things. We don't know why some things\nare easier than others. But different forms of the word, in\nmy opinion, they're different words, they have different functions, so I\ndon't mind counting them as extra. But the main thing, the point that I\nwanted to make was that this word count is an indication of your activity level. But then I started thinking about\nwhy am I so keen on adding words? So I was reading a book, or at\nleast, rather, I should say that the summary of a book came up\nin a Turkish language podcast. That I was listening to. And the book was The Happy Brain\nby, I think it's Dean Burnett. And the book makes the point that\nonce we are accustomed to certain things, we kind of derive less\npleasure or less joy from those things. He uses the example of monkeys who were\ngiven asparagus to do certain tasks, and then they started losing interest and\nthen they gave them fruit juice and then they got even more motivated and then. When they tried to go back to\nasparagus, the monkeys got all upset. The example that, you know, a\njoke is only funny the first time. It's also pointed out in the book\nthat we are always keen to eat because we have a biological need for food. But for things where there is no\nbiological need, newness is important. And Manfred Spitzer often points\nthis out that in learning things, the brain requires repetition, but\nthe brain also requires novelty. The big thing about adding words\nis that each word is a new word, at least When I discover it and when\nI see it for a second time and I add it to my Known words, total. I have a sense of something\nnew and better is happening. It's, it gives me a sense\nof joy and achievement. The fact of the matter is the number\nof words we could potentially learn in a language is almost infinite. Whereas the rules of grammar, the\nrules of usage, it's a finite number. You can get a grammar book that's\nthis thin for just about any language, and it'll cover almost all of the\nimportant things you need to know. Beyond that. You have to get used to the language,\nused to how words sort of appear with other words to sound more and\nmore like what is considered normal usage for speakers of that language. But the other thing is\nI do read grammar books. It's not like I spent all my time. Adding words to my word total. I got tons of books. Elementary Turkish. 500 words, Turkish words in context. I've got my complete Turkish. I've got my, you know, Asimil,\nLe Turk, and so on and so forth. That's, that's not even all of them. But until I added those 5, 500\nwords to my known words total, I had a lot of trouble reading them\nbecause I didn't know the words. If you are trying to understand and\nget used to a structure in the language and you don't know half the words in\nthat sentence, it's not very effective. So I now find a month after I started\ninto Turkish or started up again, where I've added all these known words. Now I go through these books\nand I understand the examples. So you need the words in order to see\nthe examples because it's the examples of usage in the target language, Turkish\nin this case, it's not the explanation in English that's going to help us that much. It's going to be exposure to\npatterns over and over again, and you need words to achieve that. And there's no question that my\nstrategy of adding known words, you know, making sure that I get 100 and\n150 new known words a day has enabled me to access these books in a way that\nwas much, much more difficult before. Now let's look at this on my iPhone. I go in, grab a course from\nour library, bring it up here. This is a lesson in the\ncourse has some blue words. So I go to the vocabulary\nreview and rather than doing the links, I go to the new words. Blue words, some of which I know,\nbut if I come across words that I don't know, I convert them to yellow\nso that I can review them later on. Words that I do know, I can claim. I make the odd mistake. It doesn't matter. I see that a word that I claim\nis known that I don't know. I'll save it later. A word that I put in the garbage\ncan, cause I thought it was a word, a name, cause I was moving too quickly. I can always go back later and undo that. So. Nothing here is perfect, but in principle\nwhat I'm doing is claiming words that I know, anything that's a name that I\ndon't want to add to my words, known words total, I basically reject it. And go through in this way, claiming words\nas known or moving them to the saved links category, like gladiator I don't want\nto take because Maybe I could, it's a word, but it's, it's also a foreign word. It's all pretty arbitrary. These are your own personal statistics\nto do with whatever you want. The main thing is it\nindicates that you're active. So then I moved to the links, which\nwords that I had previously saved or words that I have moved to links here. I can edit some of them. Like this is Germany's apostrophe\nS rather than just Germany. So I edit that. By looking it up in the\ndictionary, confirming, you know, what part of speech it is. And words that I know, I can,\nsometimes I can claim them as known. Sometimes I just want to move them up\nin status because I'm kind of getting more familiar with them, but I'm not\ntotally ready to claim them as known. Others I leave as status one and\nyou'll see I have various status words. The advantage of moving words to\nstatus three is that eventually I can go into the vocabulary section\nand harvest those status three words. And there you have it. In my previous video on this subject, I\nsaid that accumulating words was a bit like where, when I was a child, we played\nthe kissers with our hockey cards, and they would eventually, as we dropped\nthem, fluttering to the floor, some cards would land on top of another card\nand I got to collect all those cards. I think a better. Example or a better simile\nmight be a jigsaw puzzle where you have this enormous puzzle. And in the case of the language,\nit's a humongous puzzle. And as more and more of the pieces of the\npuzzle start to show up, you get a better sense of the blanks of the areas of the\npuzzle that are not yet covered by pieces. And so you have to continue adding to\nthat so that slowly the puzzle Puzzle starts to take shape and you're able to\naccess more and more difficult content. Remember in sports, you only improve if\nyou are playing against people who are at least as good as you or better than\nyou, you have to challenge yourself and it's very important to challenge yourself\nwith more and more difficult content. And we also know that the brain. Gets tired. As I say, there's less of a dopamine\nkick when you're going over the same material many, many times, far better\nto be able to access new material, where you start to know more and more of the\nwords you start to see structures of the language in different contexts, which\nmakes it easier for to remember them. Research on the brain shows that\nvocabulary accumulation, especially when it comes to verbs, is more dependent on\nseeing these in different contexts than in how many times you come across them. So enabling yourself to access words\nand structures in different contexts, because you have more and more words,\nIt's going to help you, you know, improve faster and remember those words\nand remember those structures better. Also, when we are reading and our\nability to sort of become familiar with the grammar has been called\nerror driven probabilistic process. In other words, we start to\npredict what's coming at us. We have to be able to\npredict what's coming at us. If we don't have enough words,\nif all the words that are coming at us are meaningless to us,\nwe can't predict anything. We can't predict the structure. We can't predict what\nword is going to be used. We can't predict whether that word\nor some other word is in fact, the one that should be used there. So the more words we have, the better\nwe are at predicting and therefore the faster we're going to learn the language. Now, the same is true\nwhen we come to speak. Again, through the magnetic imaging, we\nknow that when we go to make an utterance in a language, The first thing we do is\na word comes up that somehow we think of a word, and I've experienced this in my,\neven in my conversations with my Turkish tutor, that I'll just trot out a word. I see it there, out it comes. Bingo. It keeps me in the conversation. And then we trot out a structure that we\nhave used before, that we're confident in. And the third thing we do is we\nsuppress those things that don't belong. In my case, it's going\nto be a word from Farsi. From Persian, which I kind of\nthink doesn't belong, but I'm not sure, but I'd have to suppress it. So that's the process. But there again, we need this reservoir\nof words so that we can trot out the word and we can trot out the structures\nin order to stay in the conversation, hear what comes back and slowly\nimprove our ability in the language. It all requires words. But finally, you know, I've said\nthat, that working on my word count is a motivator for me. It enriches my grasp of the language. It enables me to access grammar books. It enables me to access more\nand more challenging and more and more compelling content. The words, when I review them, I make sure\nthat they are Reviewed right after having read and listened to a bit of content. And after doing that, I'll go\nback in and read the content. So I'm not just studying\nwords in isolation. So it is a motivator, but it also drives\nme to get exposed to more and more. Content, I get enjoyment from doing\nit, but I know that it's also improving my capability in the language. I'm at 15, 000 words today. My goal is to get to 30, 000 words\nso that when I get to Turkey, I can take advantage of being in\nthat Turkish language environment. So I hope that's helpful to you. And please let me know what you think. And maybe your experience is\ndifferent than my experience. Bye for now."

        "title": "Challenging myself to learn 100 WORDS EVERY DAY",
        "transcript": "Today I want to talk about the importance\nof words, the importance of known words. I made a video a little earlier about how\nmy goal in Turkish, because I'm going to Turkey, is to get at least 20, 000 known\nwords and maybe up to 30, 000 known words. Some of you may think\nthis is a large number. I want to explain to you how I do\nthat, why I do that, and how it varies depending on the language you're learning. So first of all, to me, pushing\nmyself with a known words is part of pushing myself to meet the specific\nobjectives that we can set at LingQ. I set myself a goal. I want to get over a hundred\nknown words a day, push some days to 200 known words a day. When I started a few weeks ago, I\nwas at 9, 000 known words in Turkish. I wanted to get to 20, 000. I said. I am now almost at 13, 000 and\nI believe I'll get to 30, 000. So why do I do this? Why is it important? First of all, those days when I feel a\nbit sluggish and I'm not that motivated by the content and I'm kind of not that\ninterested, I say, I still have to meet my minimum of a hundred known words. If I'm going to be going off to play golf\nthat day, I try to get in 50 or 60 known words in the morning and then finish off\nwith another 50 or 60 in the evening. Those days when I have lots of time,\nI'll push it up over 200 known words. And I will show you how I do that. So here I am, you'll see that I've\nloaded up into Turkish, a bunch of lessons that I've sort of played with. I have my mini stories that I\nregularly review or easier texts from Baja stories, Restoranda,\nSparish Vermek ve Garsonla Konu\u015fmak. However, I have this fabulous tutor and\nhe gave me some magnificent resources. So lots of stuff to work with. First thing, of course, is we want\nto start harvesting some words. So obviously if there's zero new words,\nyou're not going to harvest any new words. You have to start by collecting new\nwords that will become the yellow words. So if I go to my, uh, this guy here,\nfor example, I can use keystrokes. So that's one thing I want to show. So if you're starting up here, I can just\nmove from one, this is the yellow word. To Debbie so I can look at all the\nyellow words if I saw those look much friendship, whatever I could try and\nclaim that as known but I'm not gonna do that this time Those look ask you\nthen there so your keystrokes can move you through here pretty quickly\nThen you get sure sure sure syrup. Okay. I don't know what that is. I go Take it. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. We'll write. Let's see what they tell me. I will write. Yes, I am. I can say known. Hit it k. So I have the opportunity with my\nkeystrokes to either take it or Hit return, K, known, or X, I don't want it. So that's insofar as collecting\nand we go to the next page. So we are collecting yellow words. Remember, we're going to harvest our\nknown words from the yellow words. Now, what can I do with the yellow words? So if I go now to the bottom right hand\ncorner, we'll have a number of options. I can do flashcards. I can do different things, but\nI'm not a big flashcard fan. So I go to manage links. These are the words. That, uh, are in this lesson, but\nwhat I have to do, first of all, go to the filters and it comes from this\nRadio Teatro Su, but I don't want my known words in there and I don't want\nthe loan words in there, so I apply that first of all, because I want\nto be reviewing the yellow words. I want to be harvesting yellow words. You know, if you click on\nthis or if I click on there, all of them are highlighted. Now I have more options. I can move the status of them. I can remark them as known. I can export them to an Anki file. There's a lot of things I can do,\nbut I'm not going to do those things. So I'm going to untick here\nand I'm going to go through and see which words here I know. Acharis, we open, kind\nof, but not, not really. No, I don't know that word. I didn't say something. No, I've pardoned. I don't know. Ah, ah, I know. Ah, so I clicked that one. Ah, babam, ailejek, as a family,\nmaybe, akla, akla, akla is yeah. Let's take that one just\nto show the example. I'm not going through them all, but\nthe point is you can go and select those that you think, you know, And\nremember, we don't need to be so tough on ourselves because if we don't know them\nlater on, we can always move them back. And so then I just go more actions\nin here and make no, bingo. So it's a rather fast way of going\nthrough a list of words, yellow words. Uh, many of which might be status three. In other words, you're\nclose to knowing them. You can mark them as known. You move them to known. Now you could say that I could push\nmyself with, with creating links, with, uh, hours of listening, with words,\nreading, and, and all of these things are true and they're part of our coins\nnumber at LingQ, which is kind of. Amalgamates all these different\nactivities and they're all important and we can push ourselves however we want. But to me, the known\nwords is the final result. Creating links as an activity\ncreates the links, the yellow words that I can then go on and harvest. So it's extremely important to be getting\ninto new content where you can find new words that you can add to your activity. potential. And what we do when we create links is\nthat we take words that we come across in our listening and reading, and we\njust throw them into our brain somewhere. It's in our memory reserve. We can't use them right away. We've just seen them once,\nbut they will show up again. And as they show up again and again,\nJust by exposing ourselves to the content, listening and reading, we\nare starting to increase the number of these words that we can access. When we go to speak, we need to\nhave words in our memory reserve that we can eventually pull\nout and start to try to use. Very important to build\nup the memory reserve. Now, the yellow words in the case of\nmy Turkish, because I did some Turkish five, six years ago, there are about\n30, 000 links that I have created. Words that I came across, I don't\nknow this word, I look it up, it goes into my memory reserve. And now as I go back and forth. Back to Turkish. Of course, I'm going over a lot of\ncontent that I have looked at before, which is full of yellow words. So I'm trying now to move some\nof these yellow words to known. So actually, since starting back into\nTurkish, I haven't been doing so much reading of new content and Creating\nnew links as I've been trying to increase the number of known words. So if my known words total is now 13,\n000, my saved links total is 30, 000. So there are still a lot of words\nthat I have encountered that I put into my memory reserve that I can\nstart to activate now, having all these words in your memory reserve,\neventually some of them are going to. Click because they're similar to\nother words that you've met or you see them for the third or fourth time. I remember when I was a child we\ncollected hockey cards and we used to play against each other and\nthere were two Key games one was knockers and the other was kissers. Kissers was one where you just\nstood there and dropped your Card and it fluttered to the ground. Initially, there are\nno cards on the ground. And as you and the person you were\ncompeting with draw some more and more cards, eventually one card is\ngoing to land on top of another. And when it lands on top of another,\nyou collect all the cards and that's how we would win the game. Cards. And I, at one point had a great\nstack of hockey cards, which unfortunately my mother threw away. Anyway, the point is that the more words\nyou throw into your memory reserve, eventually they start to click for you. So very important to\nfill your memory reserve. Uh, with new words, but the yellow\nwords, the links that are already there, we have to try to convert\nsome of them to known because your vocabulary is key to comprehension. And so we talk so much about\ncomprehensible input for the input to be comprehensible. You need words. And in order to access and use more\nand more interesting and compelling input, you actually need a lot of words. I went back at some of the content\nthat I had done previously, and it's a little difficult, but it's\nnot totally beginner stuff either. And I'm able to sort of use that\nbecause I have enough words that I can fight my way through it. And as I go through it now, I'm trying\nto see if there are any words there that I can now move on to known. Now, some people say you make a big\ndeal out of the number of words, you know, but in a language like Turkish,\nthere are so many forms of the word. True. However, by treating each\nform of the word differently. As different, I can see each\ngrammatical form separately, forms of the verb, and some of those forms are\neasier to get used to than others. So I actually like seeing these\nseparate forms of these words isolated when I review these words. So again, converting your yellow saved\nlinks to known words is an indicator of how much you're interested. Increasing your level of comprehension,\nyour ability to access more and more difficult, compelling input. Alright, now let's look at ramping\nup these statistics so that I get a feeling of achievement\nand so on, which I like to do. So one thing that I mentioned was that\nI deliberately try to increase this number either in the morning or in the\nevening to make sure I meet my goal. Now there are two ways of doing this. I can simply read through some content. That has a lot of yellow words in\nit, content that I have perhaps read before or listened to. And if I see words in the text there that\nI now understand, I can move them to no. And that's a fair number. However, if I've been through a lesson\nbefore, including lessons that I did five, six years ago, lots of yellow words there. I now find that, uh, I can go to\nthe vocabulary and go to a list of the yellow words in the lesson\nthat I just read or listened to. And I'll go through that list, and\nthey're arranged in alphabetical order. And because they're in alphabetical\norder, I will see The three or four or five forms of this Turkish word, if it's\na verb particularly, and I may find that I know some of these so I can tick off. I know this word now. Okay. One, two, three, four. I picked up four known words\nand I'll go through my list. I'll even sometimes go through the\nlist because again, this is material that I looked at before, long ago. So I'll go through the list\nbeforehand, go and read the text again. And while reading it, seeing\nit in context, I might find that I understand the meaning\nof other words that I can save. Don't be too fussy. In other words, if you're not totally a\nhundred percent sure, you know the word or you know it only in this context. Take it out, claim it as a known word. You can always, you know,\nlink it again later on. It doesn't matter. But, uh, you know, I'm sort of motivated\nto get a high known word count. I find it motivating to do that,\nbut I will often find that words that I gave myself credit for\nthat are now white, I don't know them, I'll make them yellow again. Another thing to remember is. That part of your known words\ntotal is coming from words that you didn't even need to look up. If you're reading new material that\nhas some blue words in it, but you already know the meaning of that\nword because it's related to some other word, you don't look it up. You get credit for it as a known word. Uh, you can, by the way, change\nyour settings so that turning the page can either move them to\nknown or not move them to known. These are things that you can change in\nthe reader setting in the settings area. One other thing to mention is,\nyou know, when I was doing Czech, I was getting 400 words a day. And so, you know, you will do better\non some languages than others. So if you know a Romance language and\nyou're going into say from Spanish to Portuguese, or if you're going from,\nuh, Russian to Czech, you've already done some, uh, Slavic languages. You're going to find a lot of words\nthat, you know, I found that in those situations, I could go straight to\nthe vocabulary section and, uh, go to the status three words, words that I'm\nsaying, maybe a little more familiar with, and I could go and harvest lots of\nknown words straight from the vocabulary section because the vocabulary is so\nsimilar to other languages in Turkish. I can't do that. I tried it, but I don't have any cognates\nfrom other languages or very few. The cognates are mostly\nfrom Arabic and Persian. And so I try to stay close to the\ncontext, the lesson that I'm using. So I can do it, say for the whole\nlesson, I use that vocabulary list, or when I get into more difficult content,\nas I will in Turkish, then I'll do it sentence by sentence and do the\nsentence review exercises that are there. And pick up a few known words that way. At any rate, what I wanted to\npoint out is that words are key. When I first started out learning\nlanguages, I felt words were the most important measure of\nyour potential in a language. And I used to spend all my time when I\nwas doing German scouring, second hand bookstores here in Vancouver, or in Hong\nKong for Chinese books, or in Japan for Japanese books, that had word lists. Of course, nowadays we\ndon't need word lists. Because we have online dictionaries,\nwe have LingQ, we have other ways of accumulating vocabulary. And the vocabulary you accumulate,\nyou will eventually get better and better at recognizing it. It's just a natural process as\nyou see words again and again in different situations, whether\nin a list or in a context. And eventually some of these\nwill be activated, as I did today when I spoke to a Turkish tutor\nfor the first time in six years. And I was able to retrieve quite\na bit from this memory reserve. So Just a suggestion that use the,\nuh, word count at LingQ, the known words count as a motivator, and as\nan indication of your activity level as an important factor in making\nsure you progress in the language. Thank you for listening. Bye for now."

        "title": "I\u2019ve learned 20 languages: what keeps me going?",
        "transcript": "Language acquisition, as opposed to\nthe deliberate learning of languages, language acquisition is a natural process. And we learn through input\nfrom language content that. We are able to absorb in some way. That's how we transfer a language,\nwhich we don't have inside us. We bring it into us. But in order for that to work, there have\nto be some linkages, some connections. And today I want to talk about some\nof those connections and talk a bit about how I learned languages and\nwhat were the key connections, dare I say links, that brought me to the\ndifferent languages that I have learned to different levels throughout my life. The first language that I\ndeliberately sought to acquire was French, which I had at school. And so I had a lot of exposure and I, we\ndid grammar exercises and drills, but I couldn't speak until I had a professor. And I've told this story before at\nMcGill university, professor Rabotin. Who made French civilization\ninteresting to me. There was a link there. There was a connection. As a result, I ended up going to France. I studied there for three years. I hitchhiked around France. So there was a connection. Now it's easy to then connect from\nFrench to a neighboring language, neighboring in the sense of. Vocabulary and structure,\nwhich of course was Spanish. So with my French knowledge, I went\nto Spain, hitchhiked around in Spain. I would be sitting in a car with a driver\nor sitting in a truck with a truck driver. And I would have to speak the whole time. So the language was\ncoming at me all the time. And even if I didn't quite understand\nwhat they were saying, I would say something to keep the conversation\ngoing and I would acquire the language. So that connection there was from. French to Spanish and my hitchhiking\ntook me to Italy and I tried out my Spanish and I've got Italian back. And through that connection, I built\nup a bit of a sense of Italian. Ultimately though, and I think\nthis is an important point. We don't just fall into languages. A lot of effort is needed to learn\nlanguages, even related or neighboring languages, so I can remember buying\na Linguaphone series, or maybe I got a second hand for Italian and listen\nto it over and over and over again, because I couldn't treat Italian as\njust some kind of form of Spanish. It's a different language and it has\na lot of idiosyncrasies of its own. Later on, I was to learn Portuguese\nto a certain level and Romanian. I'll explain how I got there. But the thing about the Portuguese, which\nis so close to Spanish in vocabulary, in fact, for the longest time, I couldn't. I couldn't even identify it as\nPortuguese before I started studying it. It sounded to me more like Russian\nbecause the Portuguese, they kind of chew their vowels like the Russians do. So it's not obvious that\nconnection is there. It can be a source of attraction, but\nit doesn't mean you can just expect to learn the related language easily. So the next group of languages\nthat I went to was Asian languages. Now by Asian languages, I'm referring\nto Chinese, therefore Mandarin and Cantonese, and Japanese and Korean. Now I learned Mandarin. I had a lot of trouble with Cantonese. I had to devote myself to learning\nCantonese, even though the vocabulary is extremely similar, but the\npronunciation is quite different. The writing system is the same. Essentially Mandarin speakers tend\nto use simplified more, Cantonese speakers tend to use simplified. Traditional more, but the difference\nbetween the two is not very great, but then it ended up that I moved to Japan. But here again, related languages\nonly in the sense that they're part of the same culture, broadly\nspeaking, and Japanese uses Chinese characters, but the underlying\nlanguage of course is quite different. However, the attraction for\nme to learn Japanese is that. Is that I was living there. The attraction to learn Mandarin was\nthat I was sent there to learn Chinese by my employer, the Canadian government. But while living in Japan, I said,\nyou know, Korea isn't far away. Uh, it also uses Chinese characters. It should be easy for me. So that was again, the\nconnection to Korean. I have never managed to do as\nwell in Korean as I had hoped. Again, confirming the fact that\neven though there are similarities and there's a lot of shared\nvocabulary, it's still difficult. Different language. And it takes a lot of effort, a lot\nof listening, a lot of reading, and eventually a lot of speaking in order\nto become proficient in that language. Similarly, you know, Vietnamese, I visited\nVietnam with my wife and some friends, and it also has, I gather a lot of\nChinese words in their language, but I got nowhere, I grabbed a phrase book before\ngoing and I wasn't able to say anything. So related languages can\nbe a source of attraction. It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk. To learn those languages. So after the Asian languages, which\nare grouped as Asian because they're, they share vocabulary, they're\ngeographically close to each other. But they are part of\ndifferent language systems. Then I went to the Slavic system and\nmy link or the connection there was that as a teenager, I had read The\nIdiot by Dostoyevsky, Anna Karenina. It seems so exotic, you know, so I said,\ngeez, I should learn that language. Plus I want to do it without this\ntremendous focus on grammar that seems to be the style in teaching Russian. And so I learned Russian through a lot of\ninput, again, connections, for example, even, you know, movies, videos that I\ncouldn't really understand that well. It increased that connection,\nthat emotional tie. I still remember Justoki Romance,\nwhich was one of the first, uh, Russian movies that I saw, and it was, you\nknow, the vogue, uh, 19th century. It was so romantic and exotic. And that was that connection again,\nthat pulled me towards the language. Similarly, I discovered this radio\nstation, Ekho Moskvy, which had all kinds of audio and text content\non it that I could listen to daily and learn about politics in Russia. While improving my Russian after\nthat, because of course, Russian is a Slavic language and my father and\nmy parents were from Czechoslovakia. I said, you know, I should learn Czech. And I discovered this wonderful radio\nprogram called Tolki \u010ceskominulosti, which talks about the history of the\nCzech lands, you know, Bohemian Moravia. And, uh, eventually the\nAustro Hungarian empire. And, but even going back to the, uh,\nHoly Roman empire, which was largely, of course, different parts of Germany and\nAustria and, uh, having visited Prague, of course, it's all meaningful to me. And so I went from Russian\nto Czech because there's a connection there, obviously. And while I was into my Russian\nperiod, then we had the events in, in Ukraine of 2014 and someone\ndirected me towards Schuster Live, a TV program, uh, in Ukraine. At that time, the Ukrainians tended to\nspeak 50 percent of the time in Russian, 50 percent of the time in Ukrainian. I couldn't understand the Ukrainians. Uh, of course I have tremendous sympathy\nfor what they are trying to do to achieve genuine independence for their country. So then I went and learned Ukrainian. So that's still staying within that Slavic\nrange, that connection from Russian to Czech, then to Ukrainian, and then to\nPolish, because a lot of the vocabulary in Ukrainian is similar to Polish vocabulary. And of course, Ukraine was under\nPoland for a long, long time. And, uh, culturally they\nwere connected, uh, until. A range of historical events, uh,\nchanged the course of Ukrainian history, at least for parts of Ukraine. But with Ukraine and Poland now, we're\nin the Austro Hungarian empire again. So that kind of directs me towards\nRomanian and, which was part of the Austro Hungarian empire. And I was doing business in Romania, so\nI decided to learn Romanian, but it's of course connected to the Romance languages. And it was quite easy to\nlearn for that reason. Although it has some grammatical\nstructures that are different. One of the interesting grammatical\nstructures in Romanian is this sort of double conjugation, in other words, in\nEnglish, we use the infinitive, I want to go, in Romanian they say, I want, I\ngo, but they do that as well in Greek. They do it in apparently\nin other Balkan languages. So that's kind of interesting. So that was a connection,\nsort of a Balkan connection. And once we're in the Balkans, then\nwith my wife, we were in Croatia. We also went to Crete. And of course, uh, not only was Venice\na part of the Austro Hungarian empire, but of course, the Venetians were\nvery active, uh, in the old Adriatic. So in Crete, they have these wonderful\ntowns that are Venetian towns, but they speak Greek and I learned my Greek\nfor the period that we were in Crete. Now we're getting closer to Turkey\nbecause even when we were in Croatia, we went up to Sarajevo and the Turkish\ninfluence there is very evident in their buildings and the structures. There was lots of mosques\nand that kind of thing. And, uh, there are still, uh,\nTurkish speakers in, in the Balkans. So now we move to the other\nside of the, uh, Hellespont. Because I visited Jordan,\nI got interested in Arabic. And so I'm learning Arabic. And then I decided to learn Farsi, which\nit shares the writing system, shares about 15 percent of the vocabulary with Arabic. But it's a Indo European language. And of course, once you start studying\nthe history of that region, you see the extent to which even in the\nCaliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and more so in the Abbasid Caliphate,\nthe Persian speakers and the Turks who were more of the soldiers. We're very influential\nin those governments. And eventually they would go off\nand form other, you know, countries. And the Turks were very influential\nin establishing certain, uh, you know, Iranian dynasties, the\nSafavid dynasty, for example. And if we venture further afield\ninto central Asia, we see this mixing of Farsi and Turkish in\nSamarkand and Bukhara and so forth. And if you want to further afield,\nwe'll get to the Uyghurs who at one point had a powerful state. And, uh, even in China during the\nTang dynasty, Turkish soldiers and generals and, uh, and\nPersians were very influential. And of course, Buddhism\ncame through the Silk Road. So. Everything connects, it's connections. And when we learn the language, we learn\nnew words and we connect them to words that we already know, which is why I\nonly ever use a bilingual dictionary. I cannot understand how people can\nlearn a language using a monolingual dictionary, where they see explanations\nin the language they're trying to learn, where they're inevitably going to\nfind many words they don't understand. Connected to words, you know, Connected\nto feelings you have connected to memories you have when you go to speak, you have\nto connect what you would like to say your utterance has to connect somehow\nto words and structures that you have in memory that you can pull out and start\nusing neurons connect with each other. So it's all about connections. And actually, when we. Created link, the reason we\ncall it link, not link you. And why we went with that word\nwas that to me, connections, linkages, they are, that is such a\nbig part of, of language learning. And so I just was thinking about that,\nthat the other day, and I thought it would be kind of interesting to take you\nthrough a bit of a walk through some of the languages I have learned, how they\nconnect, why they connect and where it helped me and where it didn't help me. So there you have it. And, uh, I look forward to your comments. Thank you. Bye."

        "title": "How to learn a language for a trip abroad",
        "transcript": "Travel and language learning,\nthe two are connected. How do they work together? How do we improve our travel\nexperience by learning a language? How does the travel experience\nimprove our ability to learn? I would like to talk about this because\nI think it's kind of key to the whole experience of language learning, because\nwhen we learn a language, we either are doing it, you know, away from\nwhere the language is spoken, or we're doing it Where the language is spoken. Most of us, of course, are in\na situation where we are not surrounded by the language. The ideal scenario is to be surrounded by\nthe language, but being in an environment where the language is spoken is no\nguarantee that you'll learn the language. I lived in Japan, most foreigners\nthere didn't speak Japanese beyond being able to say konnichiwa,\nsubarashi desu ne, a few phrases. Lots of immigrants in Canada\nor elsewhere live for 30 years and hardly speak the language. On the other hand, many people become\nquite fluent without going to the country. However, ideal scenario. You're surrounded by the language. You can use it all the time. And the reason I'm talking about this is\nthat I'm learning Turkish because my wife and I are going to Turkey in October. So I am preparing myself and I'm\ngoing to talk about the things that I'm doing to prepare for my trip. Things that I have done in the past\nthat didn't work and things that have worked and things that I hope\nwill work for me in going to Turkey. All right. So there are people who say, go to the\ncountry and you'll learn the language. Get a phrase book. Go there, start speaking to people. And somehow if you're there for a few\nweeks, you'll pick up the language. It doesn't work. I have done it. I have done it for Vietnamese. I did it for Portuguese. I did it for Croatian. It doesn't work. Most situations that they describe in the\nphrase book, you're in a grocery store, you're at the doctor's office, heaven\nforbid, or you're at the train station. You can't trot out the phrases. You end up using English or nowadays\nyou use Google Translate on your iPhone. So the phrase book is not going\nto get you to a level where you can function in the language. And I did all of these for Vietnamese. Vietnamese in 60 minutes. I put a lot of effort into it. Getting started in Vietnamese. Vietnamese flashcards. I did it all. And And, you know, no matter how much\nyou deliberately try to learn the grammar, the vocabulary with flashcards\nor phrasebooks, it's not enough. You'll still end up only having,\nyou know, a very limited level of communication with the locals. So that's the first thing\nthat I want to point out. In order to optimize, maximize your\nexperience when you're in the country where the language is spoken, you have\nto work very hard before you go there. And where I have been successful. Russian, Czech, Ukrainian, Romanian,\nGreek, those are situations where I put enough effort into the language\nin order to be able to actually have meaningful conversations. One of my benchmarks has been the\nnumber of words that I know on LingQ, 20, 000, 30, 000, quite a high number. Has normally been my target. So I looked at my numbers in LingQ\nand back in 2019, I spent three months on Turkish, it ended up that\nI had about 9, 000 known words, the way we count them on, on LingQ, and\nI said, I'm going to at least need. 20, 000 and I've got a hundred\nand some days now, a hundred days, 120 days before I go. So my first goal is to make sure that I\nstay with it, work with Turkish on LingQ enough that I can generate at least a\nhundred words a day of new known words. What I am finding is that in the case\nof Turkish, it's actually quite easy to accumulate known words because so many of\nthe words have so many different forms. Because each word, depending on the\nending, can be a different person, a different tense, different intention. Uh, in case of verbs, the possessive\nor the direction, all this stuff changes with these endings. And so very quickly, once you've gotten\none or two words, or you've seen it in a few places, and then you're familiar\nwith what these endings do, you start to accumulate words very, very quickly. So the good news there is\nthat I will no 000 words. The bad news is that 20,\n000 words may not be enough. The word counted link, people\ncomplain, every form of the word is counted as a separate word. It's the only way we can do it\nbecause the system counts words that you save and don't save. If you don't save a word, the\nassumption the system makes is that you know the word. So it can be counted. However, not a bad thing. It's a different function in the sentence. So, to that extent, I don't mind that I'm\naccumulating all of these known words. It's motivating to see yourself\naccumulating a lot of known words. Besides which, the known word total is\njust a measure of your level of activity. So, if I'm able to maintain\n150, 200 known words a day. That indicates that I'm spending that\nmuch time reading and listening and saving words and accumulating known words. In a subsequent video, I will go into\ndetail of how I add these words, the different things that I do, both in my\nvocabulary section and when I am working on the computer or working on my iPhone. But they accumulate quite quickly. But the point I want to make is that in\norder to be comfortable when you go to Mexico or you go to China or wherever you\ngo, Japan, you actually need a high level. So deliberately trying to nail specific\nwords, phrases, scenarios is not going to do it because you need a very broad\nbase, a deep base in the language in order for these things to connect. What I find is. If I pick up a phrase book after I\nhave already accumulated a fairly large vocabulary in the language, then the\nphrases have a chance of sticking. If I don't do that, as in the case of\nwhen I went to Vietnam, and I put a fair amount of effort into it over a few weeks. I don't know. The only thing I could say in Vietnam\nwas come on, which means thank you. That's all because it's\nsimilar to come on in English. Nothing else stuck. The same in Croatia, even though I spoke\nother Slavic languages and I worked a bit on my Croatian and I had a Croatian\nhere, even a Serbian Croatian, it's more or less the same phrase book and nothing. No way. Because. It happens fast and you've got to be\nable to produce the language naturally. And the phrase books don't do it. So when we take a whole language approach,\nthen it's a matter of not only of getting into the language and acquiring words. And I don't know what that minimum level\nmight be for Turkish or for Spanish or for other languages, but the thing is\nto get active, get into the culture. For example, I'm using YouTube. I've found a cooking channel at YouTube. I've found a, you know, a comedian at\nYouTube whom I recognize in a Netflix video, learning about the history. So the greater my sort of general\nfamiliarity with the language, the culture, the background, the food, all\nthese things, it makes it easier for me. And with all of this preparation,\nthere will be fewer surprises. I'll be at a higher level so that\nwhen I get there, I'm hoping. Okay. That I'll be able to function. We will see. Now, the final thing I want to\npoint out, what I make is that the trip to say Turkey, in my\ncase, that's not the end goal. It's simply a milestone in my journey\ntowards a better understanding of Turkish. Because if you go there and I've done this\nnow for other languages and you function to some extent, and you're able to enjoy\nyour stay, because you have a sufficient level in the language that you don't feel. Sort of like a fish out of water, but\nthen you come back and if you don't use the language, don't do anything in the\nlanguage, it'll start to go downhill. However, the good news is that when you\ngo back there or when you study it again, it all comes back stronger than ever. And that's been my experience. So it's not the final step. You're going to have to. Go back there, but when you go back\nthere, it'll be stronger than ever. And in the case of my Turkish, my\ngoal is not to go there and be able to speak to the waiter in a restaurant. My goal is to take advantage of my\nvisit to Turkey to move my knowledge of Turkish forward, a, because it's\nvery concrete goal I'm preparing for my visit to Turkey, that's motivating me. And when I get there, I'll be\nusing it for the 10 days or 15 days that we are in Turkey. But I'm interested in Turkish history. I'm interested in the sense of. You know, the Turks in Central Asia and\nthen the Ottoman Empire, and they were, uh, they controlled the Balkans and\npowering of science a thousand years ago. And the sort of interaction between\nTurks and Persians and Arabs and the Arabic language and all of\nthat is part of that history. And so I will continue to explore\nthose things using the different resources that are out there. And I think that the encouragement\nI hope that I get from my visit will spur me on to continue with my Turkish. As long as I'm not distracted\nby going after other languages and there's so many languages to\nexplore, there's never a dull moment. Anyway, that's my advice. If you are planning to, you know, work\non your language with a goal of visiting the country, don't think you can just\narrive there with a phrase book and somehow your language skills will improve. That has not been my experience. It may work for you. Rather, put as much effort as you can. Um, into the language before you go,\nand that'll make it more likely that you will truly benefit from being\nthere in order to, you know, further develop your skills in that language. And I will leave you a couple of videos\nI've talked on this subject before. So thank you for listening. Bye."

        "title": "Speaking or comprehension: which comes first?",
        "transcript": "Today I'm going to talk about speaking. I'm going to talk about output, and I'm\ngoing to begin by saying that speaking, just speaking, is not communicating,\nand I'll tell you what I mean by that. A number of people have asked me to do\na video about the output hypothesis. Now, you are familiar with Stephen\nKrashen's Input Hypothesis, and I'm a great fan of Krashen's\nHypothesis on how we learn. And let me just go over the five main\npoints of Krashen's Input Hypothesis. And then I'm going to talk a little\nbit about the Output Hypothesis and explain what I consider to be the\nrelationship between output or speaking and genuine communication and learning\nin the acquisition of a language. Krashen's Theory of Language\nAcquisition consists of five points. The first point is. What he calls the input hypothesis. We learn from meaningful input, input\nthat's just a little difficult for us, hopefully input of interest,\nand that this is a natural process. And this leads us to point number two. And that is the distinction that Krashen\nmakes between learning and acquisition. Learning is a deliberate study of the\nlanguage and in his mind, it's completely disconnected from the sort of subconscious\nprocess of acquiring a language. Then there is the monitor hypothesis,\nwhich says that grammar instruction, or the rules of grammar that we study,\nbecome a monitor, and if we speak trying to use the language while referring to\nthis monitor, it makes us less spontaneous and less able to use the language. The fourth point in Krashen's theory of\nlanguage acquisition is the natural order of acquisition, which says that regardless\nof whichever rules we study or the effort put in by teachers to drill us or test\nus on certain forms or structures in the language, we will gradually acquire\nthese according to a natural order. We will learn some faster than others, and\nI've referred to this before in my videos. And finally, Krashen refers to the\naffective filter, which says the more stress the learner is placed under, the\nmore fear, the more sense of intimidation, the harder it is to produce the language. This is called the affective, like\nthe emotional, the affective filter. Obviously, it's a filter. Something that we want to minimize. Now, because this theory, Krashen's\ntheory of language acquisition and the emphasis on input had become very\npopular, there was a counter theory proposed by a Canadian language\nteacher called Merrill Swain and based on her experience with, uh, English\nspeaking kids in the, uh, French immersion program in Canadian schools. So she said that there are three. Sort of points in her output hypothesis. Output is important because of the\nnoticing hypothesis that by outputting learners become aware of the gaps in\ntheir knowledge, uh, where they might think they know something when they go\nto speak and it doesn't, you know, come out that way they would like, or they\ndiscover errors, then this helps them notice the gaps in their knowledge. The second aspect of the output\nhypothesis was what she called the hypothesis testing function. And that is that learners would have\nsome hypothesis about how the language works and that by speaking they are\nable to test whether their understanding of the language in fact corresponds\nto The way the language works. And the third thing she talks about\nis metalinguistic function, which is some ability for the learner to gain\na better sort of overall sense of the structure of the language through output. So there you have it, the input\nhypothesis and the output hypothesis. The output hypothesis, Merrill Swain\ndeveloped this theory based on looking at French immersion kids. She claimed that, uh, the\nkids in French immersion. And she was doing this work in\nthe seventies, uh, acquired native like comprehension in French, but\nthat certain errors in grammar persisted in their output. My three grandchildren who went\nto school here in Canada, they all went to French immersion. Uh, two of them are not available. So I spoke to my grandson and got\nsome more insight on French immersion. So first of all, the input in a French\nimmersion class, Is largely what comes from the teacher or their reading, uh,\nbecause there's 25, 30 English speaking kids in a classroom, the teacher speaks\nto them in French, they reply to the teacher in French, or they're supposed\nto, they're supposed to speak French to their classmates and they don't. So the amount of input they\nget is, is somewhat limited. It's nowhere near the kind of\ninput that we recommend at LingQ. That people need, you know, hours\nand hours and hours of listening in order to acquire a language. So it's limited input. Their major output activity is writing. True.\nThey don't get to speak very much. They might reply to the teacher. My grandson said it would\nhave been a good idea. And maybe this is something that's\npossible nowadays to have a Zoom session. With French speaking school kids in\nQuebec or in France or Belgium or some French speaking country somewhere\nelse, but that was not the case. They didn't do that. So writing, but writing is very good\nand they used to write by hand and that was a very good way to generate output. And of course, when you're writing,\nyou have the time to look things up and work on your grammar. They also had a lot of\ngrammar instructions. However, the net result is they do\ncontinue making a lot of grammar mistakes. And I know from my own experience, when\nI went to school and we did French, we had a lot of grammar instruction. And I also continued making a lot\nof mistakes until I had had enough input because I became motivated and I\nlistened and I read books and I watched movies and eventually went to France. So the thought that somehow. A more grammar focused or output\nfocused, you know, approach to teaching in the schools is going to reduce the\namount of errors that the kids make. I, I'm somewhat skeptical. And, uh, I go back to Krashen's\nnatural order of acquisition. I go back to the fact that people who\nare very fluent in English that I've done business with from different\ncountries, they continue to make mistakes. Like we continue to make mistakes. That's just part of the process\nof acquiring a language. And so this gets me to the\npoint of like, what is output? What is speaking? Why do we want to put\npressure on people to speak? Communicating implies a two\nway flow of information. If you can output something, if you can\nsay something, but you don't understand what the other person is saying. You are not communicating. So an emphasis on output, getting\npeople to speak, getting people to speak in a non meaningful way. And that's where my grandson's suggestion\nof having a, uh, an exchange with the students from a French speaking\nschool is so good because then it becomes meaningful communication. However, if the teacher is then\nmonitoring this communication between school kids in say Quebec and West\nVancouver, and the kids are aware of that, that introduces again, this. Effective filter, the concern that they\nwill be judged on how well they speak, which of course is counterproductive. What you want them to do is\nto engage in communication. Try out what they can try or what\nthey feel comfortable using and gradually grow their language skills. In fact, from the research on how\nthe brain gets to output, it's clear that the brain will throw something\nout that's in its memory, that's put there either through listening\nor reading or whatever, speaking. It's sort of thrown on\nthe wall, so to speak. And it gets the conversation going if\nwe're struggling in a new language. And then the second thing the\nbrain does is it goes to a structure that we used before. That again, sort of scaffolds the speaker\nwho's uncertain in the language into at least being able to produce something. And then it'll pick up on what comes\nback, but we do need to have this treasure chest of words and structures\nthat we've heard so often and read so often that we're confident in trying\nthem out above and beyond the fact that we need to be able to understand\nwhat the other person is saying. So here again, just being able to\nsay something, a limited number of things, not understand what's said\nback to you is not communicating. And the difficulty with trying to\npressure people to speak before they're ready is that they can only use a\nvery limited range of vocabulary. This means that the other. Party to the conversation can only use a\nlimited range of vocabulary back at them. So the opportunity for growth in sort of\nlanguage knowledge there is quite limited. And finally, grammar is not communicating. I played golf again the other day with. Uh, a young man who went to the Royal\nMilitary College in Kingston, Ontario. And one of their four pillars\nthere is bilingualism. So you have to be fluent in French. And, uh, he said that he had no\ntrouble with the speaking and the comprehension and the reading. But when he was asked to say\nwhether this was This particular verb was in l'imparfait or le\npass\u00e9 simple or le pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9. All these grammatical\nterms, he was stumped. So grammar is kind of an overlay of\ncomplication over developing a natural sense of how words are used and which\nwords are used with other words. And I remember when I was correcting\npeople at LingQ that in English, it was far more common for learners\nTo make mistakes in word usage. In other words, use words together that\nare not normally used together rather than obvious quote, grammatical mistakes. That's not to say that you can't look at\na grammar book and I do from time to time. I'm doing it now in Turkish, but I\ndon't expect to remember anything from the grammar explanation or\nthe grammar instructions rather. I hope that that'll help me notice certain\nthings when I'm reading and listening. So again, it's not to argue about\nwhich hypothesis is correct. I think the important thing\nis where do we want to spend our time as language learners? Of course we want to speak. We want to speak a lot eventually. When we speak, should we worry\nabout how accurate our grammar is? If the grammar will gradually\nget better anyway, shouldn't we just enjoy communicating? Put the emphasis on communicating with as\nlittle stress as possible and hopefully in a meaningful way and sort of combine\nthat with our continued input activities. And in that way, we will gradually\nachieve what we want, which is effective, meaningful communication\nin the language we're learning. Thanks for listening."

        "title": "Would I use Duolingo to learn a new language?",
        "transcript": "So I'm going to do a\nlittle bit of Duolingo. I'm going to look at two\nlanguages, Turkish and Hindi. Turkish, because my wife and I are\ngoing to go to Turkey in the fall. As a result of this, I've decided\nto sort of slow down my Arabic and Persian and focus in on Turkish. And that's a language where I\nhave already spent some time. You'll see from my statistics\nthat four years ago, I spent three months on Turkish. So I do have some knowledge of Turkish. I'm probably sort of at an\nA2 verging on the B1 level. I'm not entirely sure what those\nlevels mean, but I have some knowledge of Turkish and Hindi, of\ncourse, I'm starting from scratch. Turkish is written in the Latin alphabet. Therefore it's easier. Hindi, of course, it has\nits own writing system. So different scenarios and what I will do. Is I will get on the Duolingo here and I\nwill record the screen and a comment as I'm going through it, and we will talk\nagain after my experience with Duolingo. So Greek and Arabic is what I did before,\nbut this time I'm interested in Turkish. And there it is. So Turkish is loading. So I got to decide where I am. I'm about a quarter of the way through. In terms of my knowledge, I think. They promised that I'll be able\nto converse with confidence. I don't believe that, but we'll see. 15 minutes a day makes\nme a serious learner. Okay. That's not very much, but whatever. No, I'll find my level. All right. We are reading, I think. Let's see. Oh, the book. Yeah. All right. Now, this isn't very difficult\nbecause capital means that's the first word in the sentence, but anyway. The cat is sleeping. Now, again, there's only one\nchoice, so that's gotta be it. I'm a bit sort of surprised\nthat it would be so simple, but that seems to be the thing. So these are pretty easy, and yet\nit's still possible to get them wrong. I'm not too clear what the verb for\nraining is, but I'll give it a try. Under a little pressure here. Ah, yeah you are. So I got the first person\nand third person confused. I got the third person right this time. Still getting used to my Turkish verbs. I understand the principle. It's just applying it. Yeah, so that's your\nson instead of your sin. So I'm a star here. Yeah, that's not so hard. Nah, I'm just guessing. A form of ah, okay. There's two I's there, I\nhave no idea which it is. It's wrong, okay. Not sure. Sounds like an A, that's not right. Now I gotta match pairs,\nlike not a chance, just total guesswork, total guesswork. Maybe the third one down,\nah, ah, is, I do remember. That one is okay. That's a guess. All right, now what? Yeah, I keep on getting this one wrong. I get, I guess eventually if I get\nin the language, and when I get in the language, these things will\nbecome natural to me, but right now they're pretty much of a mystery. I guess I had a 30 percent, 33 percent\nchance of getting it right, but I didn't. So now what are they asking? You'll lose your progress if you quit. Now keep learning. You ran out of hearts,\nso what do I do now? And they asked me to buy\nmore gems or something. I'm not going to do that at this point. So I'm, I'm a bit confused at\nthis point as to how I continue. It's supposed to be free, you\nknow, go, you lose your progress. Okay. I got no choice. I'm going to end the session. So what's my reaction to Duolingo? Bear in mind, I have. I've kind of played with it in the past. I think it's better now. It's more fun. And I think the, the positive side\nof Duolingo is that it is fun. It's easy to do. You can do it five minutes a day. If you do 15 minutes a day, you're\nconsidered a serious learner. It's fun to get things right. It's even fun to get things wrong and\nto be reminded of things that you still, you know, don't know or haven't mastered. So it is just an overwhelmingly\npleasant experience. And it does contribute to,\nif not teaching you a lot. At least enabling you to do things\nwith the language that confirm what you know, and what you don't know. The problem with Duolingo is\nthat A, 15 minutes a day is not going to get you very far. It's even suggesting you can do\nfive minutes a day and it deals with such small disjointed things. Parts of the language and you have no\ncontrol over what you're going to learn. So if I look at the case of Turkish,\nfor example, once I decided that we were going to go to Turkey, of\ncourse, I went and grabbed my Assimil Le Turk, which I've done before. So I'd go after this. I have other books on Turkish. This is only some of the\nbooks I have on Turkish. So the point I'm trying to make is. And there's lots there, there's lots of\nthings associated with that language. And I want to be able to explore what\nI want to explore at my pace, going forward, going backwards, reviewing stuff\nthat I did before, of course, I've been spending a lot of time with our mini\nstories at LingQ, listening to them. Going through them, saving\nwords, seeing words that I've saved before that I now refresh. But doing all of that, I might still\nmaybe want to spend five, 10, 15 minutes a day confirming what I know. The problem in Duolingo is that\nI can't control what comes at me. They control. So I can't deliberately review\nwords from a particular lesson. I just have to, you know, perform based on\nwhatever they give me and hopefully derive some satisfaction from performing well. If I look at the Hindi. So here again, like I buy books, okay. If I'm going to learn a language,\nI haven't even started on Hindi. And even though I'm a bit skeptical\nof teach yourself, it is a source. I love doing the beginner material in\na language using different materials, different sources, different books,\ndifferent systems, because it's covering sort of the same ground from a\ndifferent angle and books are relatively inexpensive compared to going to a\nschool or engaging with a teacher. And when it comes to the Hindi\nwriting system, again, In Duolingo, it comes at you so quickly. I don't hear the text\nto speech very clearly. I'm given sort of a microscopic\nview of a few of the letters. I want to start with more of an overview. So I got myself a book like\nthis, where I have to actually trace the letters by hand. So when I go and do this. I will work at learning the letters. Of course, I'll forget\nthem as I learn them. And I may very well go to Duolingo to\nreview my knowledge of the letters. And then as we get into Hindi itself,\nI will of course use the mini stories because there's so much repetition. These are stories that make sense,\nbut it's possible that I will go. To Duolingo, although honestly, maybe not. I mean, there's only so\nmuch time that I can spend. I have an hour, an hour\nand a half a day to spend. If I get engaged with content that\nI'm listening to and I'm looking up the words or I'm going into a\nlesson in sentence mode, that I'm probably going to continue doing that. However, for people who are maybe\nless motivated or who like to maintain contact with the language they're\nlearning, then I think Duolingo is fine. I was playing golf the other day. And this lady came up to me and she\nknows, of course, that I'm with LingQ. And she said, Oh, you know, I've done\n1500 days consecutive streak on a Duolingo in Spanish, and I know that she has\nlived in Thailand and speaks some Thai. Her husband is a French\nspeaking Swiss person. And so she's pretty good at languages. And I said, so can you speak Spanish now? And she said, no, that's the only problem. I still can't speak. Yeah, because she's getting\nthe language in little dribs and drabs and bits and pieces. And so that's fine, but maybe not if\nthat's the only thing you're doing. So you've still got to go and do all\nthese other things and use Duolingo as a, as an entertaining way of testing\nyourself, getting some feedback, getting a sense of achievement and\nmaintaining a contact with the language. So that's essentially what\nI have to say on Duolingo. I hope you won't feel that I was\nbeing too negative in commenting on a, Competitive system, although\nI don't see it as competitive. I see it as something that could be\ncomplimentary to books, LingQ, and all the other things that we do."

        "title": "Why mindset is KEY to successful language learning",
        "transcript": "Someone asked me to do a video about\nMindset, the book by Carol Dweck, and to talk about the mindset that\nleads to success in language learning. So I'm going to talk a bit about her book. I'm going to talk about some other\nself help books that are related, and then I'm going to give you what\nI consider to be the six keys to a successful language learning mindset. So the book itself, Mindset, Changing\nthe Way You Think to Fulfill Your Potential, million copy bestseller. I found it very difficult to read\nbecause essentially she says the same thing over and over again. She sort of says that, uh, even in\npreschool years, we are either sort of, Free determined to be what she calls fixed\nmindset people or growth mindset people. And if we are praised too much for\nbeing smart, or if we develop the kind of feeling that we have to be perfect\nin everything we do, then we are fixed. Mindset people. But if we recognize that difficulties\nand hard work, criticism and all of this leads to growth, then\nwe are growth mindset people. But first and foremost, I\nfeel it's very difficult to categorize people in this way. I think people that I've come\nacross are to some extent, you know, fixed or sensitive, a bit. To criticism and yet at the same\ntime, they want to grow and improve. So I'm not sure that people can\nbe, you know, divided in that way. I did a bit of research to see if\nthere was any, uh, you know, brain research, neurological neurocognitive\nstudies, which would indicate that there was such a distinction. And I found one reference, but\nagain, lots of circular reasoning there, which says that growth. Mindset people respond better to some\nkind of stimulus, but it was sort of circular in that because they respond\nin this way, therefore they are growth mindset people, not clear that there is\nthis clear distinction of, of people. The other problem with her book\nand with many self help books is that the same thing is kind\nof repeated over and over again. I got the audio book as well because my\nwife doesn't like to listen to my Persian and Arabic when we're driving in the car. I tried to get something that\nwe can both listen to and we both found it very hard to hear. I couldn't get through her 200 pages,\nso I started looking for short form summaries on the internet, which I\nfound, which gave me a sense of what was there and kind of confirmed that\nthere wasn't an awful lot there. But it led me to a few other books,\nwhich I want to mention before I get into what I consider to be the six\nkeys of a successful language learning. The first one is Drive by Daniel Pink. He talks about how people have\na need for autonomy, a sense of purpose, relevance in their lives. And I think this is true. And I think that's another major problem\nI have with dividing people into Fixed mindset people and growth mindset people. I think we all have similar urges,\nsimilar needs, and this has been described as a sense of flow. And we have a task that is perhaps\na little bit difficult for us, and we're able to manage that task,\nand then we get a sense of flow. Being in that state of flow where\nalmost effortlessly, totally absorbed by the task at hand, achieving some\nsuccess in the task, we achieve a level of happiness and satisfaction. And I think all of us are\ncapable of achieving that. In fact, to some extent for Carol\nDweck to suggest that whether we're fixed mindset people or growth\nmindset, people is determined. Preschool, that means we have no\nopportunity to change, which sort of goes against the idea that we can through,\nyou know, a willingness to change, which presumably is why she wrote her book,\nwe can alter our belief system so that we are more inclined to believe that\nwe can improve, that we can learn, that we can accept criticism and so forth. And I think we can. I've talked before about the book,\nthe mind and the brain and how We can influence our belief system. I also mentioned the book by, um,\nthe Danish writer, Think Less and Live More, where again, talks about\nthis metacognitive therapy, whereby our belief system can influence how\nwe deal with things in our lives. So I tend not to be of the sort\nof predetermined you are type A or type B school, which is more\nof the behavioral side of things. I think that there are a lot of things\nthat go on in our brain, which we are starting to understand better and better. And that we can influence\nwhat happens there. Another book that I discovered in summary\nis The Happiness Advantage by Sean Etcher. I hope that's how he pronounces his name. And his point is that happiness is\nbased on the idea that we anticipate good things happening to us. We have an ability to predict\nwhat's going to happen. When we have that feeling that we can\nanticipate or predict something positive happening, then of course we put effort\ninto learning, for example, because we achieve happiness in the thought that\nwe have some control over our lives. He talks about an\ninternal locus of control. We feel we're in control, and this\ngives us a sense of happiness. And I think the idea of happiness, as a\nmajor, Driver of our motivation, driver of our actions is an important concept. And I'll get back to that when\nI talk about my six keys to a successful language learning mindset. The first key is curiosity. No one is going to learn a\nlanguage if they aren't curious about that language at some level. They may be curious about the\nculture, about the country. They may be curious about\nthe language itself. They may feel a need to learn the language\nbecause of work, because of relatives, but if they aren't curious about the language\nitself, they won't be very successful. So number one key is curiosity. That's what gets you going. Now the second key to a successful\nlanguage learning mindset. The second is confidence. You have to believe you can do it. You have to say, I can\nlearn this language. If you don't think you can learn the\nlanguage, you will not learn the language. If you don't think you can climb\nto the top of the mountain, you won't even get halfway. So it's very important to have\nthat sense that you can do it. And in that regard, we can all do it. Some may learn better. Some may learn more slowly,\nbut we can all learn. So that confidence that we can\nlearn is extremely important. The third mindset is one of. Perseverance or resilience, you\nwill encounter difficulties. You will encounter texts\nthat are too difficult. You will find yourself in situations where\nyou can't remember the words you need, or where you can't understand a conversation,\nor where you disappoint yourself. You can't quit. You have to keep going. Because, again, as Carol Gleck\npoints out, even going through the difficulty, you are learning. You have to believe that you're\nconstantly learning, and if you believe you're constantly learning,\nyou, therefore, Believe that you will eventually get to a level. A level may not be as\ngood as someone else. And again, referring back\nto Carolyn Dweck's book, you don't have to be the best. You just have to keep going and you\nwill eventually reach your goal. Fourth key of a successful language\nlearning mindset is to accept uncertainty. You will be in situations\nthat you can't control. If someone says something to you\nthat you don't understand, uh, you're going into a conversation and you're\nnot sure how you're going to do. All of these things are part\nof that learning process. of learning the language. If you totally owned the language, if\nit was as good as your native language, you wouldn't be learning it any longer. So we have to accept uncertainty. We have to accept not fully\nunderstanding as we're reading something, and not fully understanding\nas we're listening to something. Getting things right one\ntime and wrong the next time. All of this we have to learn to accept. So to that extent, with reference\nto Carol Dweck's book, you can't be sort of fixed mindset. You have to be growth mindset where\nyou accept all of the uncertainty and errors that are going to come your way. Number five key is have a mindset where\nyou can visualize and I was playing golf the other day and someone said that it's\nimportant to visualize the golf swing. And he said that he heard somewhere that\nthey did a test where they took, say, 10 college basketball players in the States. And, uh, 10 of them were told to practice,\nuh, throwing free throws for a week. And the other group was asked to\ndaily visualize the golf swing. It's throwing accurate free throws. And it turns out at the end of\nthe week, the group that was visualizing performed better than\nthe group that had been practicing. Now in language learning, again,\nyou visualize yourself becoming better and better in the language. Try to picture yourself a\nFrenchman or a Chinese person or, you know, Japanese or Brazilian. Try to visualize yourself as one of them. That will reduce the amount of\nresistance you have to the language. And it will enable you\nto progress more quickly. So the ability to visualize is a big part\nof a successful language learning mindset. And finally, we learn\nlanguages for ourselves. So it doesn't matter what\nother people say about you. You're not performing in\nfront of other people. You're learning for your own reasons. I'm quite content with my Arabic, which\nI don't speak very well or Persian, but I'm able to participate in the language\nby, you know, following news programs, which I can import into LingQ and I can. Study in sentence mode at my pace\nslowly, but I'm doing it for myself. I'm not moving very quickly,\nbut I'm taking my time. I am enjoying being in the moment. As I hear someone from Lebanon talk\nabout the situation in the Middle East, for example, some people are totally\nmotivated to speak all the time and try out their language wherever they can. A large part of my motivation comes\nfrom, you know, listening and reading, but that's not to say that I am not. Not also open to the pleasure of\nexchanging some words in the language with someone who speaks that language. For example, uh, there's this great\nCanadian superstore, which is a supermarket here in Vancouver, in\nNorth Vancouver, and there are a lot of Iranian employees there. So whenever I go there, I'm sort\nof looking forward to perhaps being able to use my Persian. So I went and bought whatever I had\nto buy and I look for a checkout. Lane where there's a person with\ndark hair that might be, uh, Persian. So I move into this lane and\nthere's this, uh, young lady there. So I speak to her in Persian. I say, \"H\u0101l\u00e9 shom\u0101 chetor-\u00e9?\" And she's, Oh,\nno, I don't understand. She's Romanian. Well, I remembered a bit of my Romanian\nbecause I had learned Romanian. And in order to go to Romania\nback, you know, seven, eight, nine years ago, I trotted out whatever\nlittle bit I was able to retrieve. She was delighted. She said, you made my day. So then what happens? I go home. Now I've been motivated. Jeez, I got to get back to my Romanian. So I grabbed my Assimil Romanian. I start doing my Romanian mini stories\nat LingQ because that, that inspires me. It's, it's a reason that came\nalong out of the blue and what's significant about that, other than it\nbecomes now a source of motivation. One key thing that happens to\nus in life is that little sparks can come to us and make us happy. You know, I'm not a very good golfer,\nbut if I play a good game of golf, I'll just feel happy, you know, when I'm\ndoing the dishes, I'm happier, I'm happy. Little things like that, that we're\nnot aware of why they make us happy. But they make us happy and that\nlittle spark could come from anywhere. And so we need to be open to that. And when those things happen\nto our language learning for very personal reasons, that can\nbecome a source of motivation. So we can all have our\nown different reasons. We learn languages for our own reasons. Sort of to summarize, I think it's\na little bit, um, almost pessimistic view to say that we are either\nfixed mindset or growth mindset. I think we are all a bit of both. We have different levels of\ntalent, but we can all maximize the potential that we have. And to some extent, even our\nlevel of motivation can vary. So some people are more motivated. Some people are more sensitive to some\nextent, these sort of characteristics exist in all of us, but nothing prevents\nus from having an attitude, a willingness to change our belief system, a willingness\nto accept criticism, a willingness to try harder to expose ourselves to\nthe criticism of others, speaking a language that we don't speak very well. We can all improve. So to what extent some of us fall into\nthe camp of fixed mindset people or growth mindset people, it really doesn't matter. It's what we do with these\nmindsets that matters. It's what we do with our\ntalent, with our attitudes. That's what matters. And with that, we can slowly develop\nmore of a growth mindset and achieve our goals, not only in language\nlearning, but also in other activities. Thank you for listening."
